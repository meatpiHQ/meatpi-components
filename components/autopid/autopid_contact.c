/**
 * @file autopid_contact.c
 * @brief First contact, once per boot: which car is this, and how does it
 *        want to be asked (TASK_quick_setup.md second pass; dialects:
 *        TASK_j1939_wwh.md phase 3). Split out of autopid_runner.c
 *        2026-10-03 (700-line rule). Poller-task context.
 *
 * The boot prelude pins the protocol the setting names, or under "0" the
 * one the vehicle store learned for the current car. After the first
 * SUCCESSFUL poll the identity requests (autopid_identify.c) go out and the
 * store decides: the same car, another stored car (switch), or an unknown
 * one (the detection job). A stored protocol that stays silent for the
 * first AP_BOOT_SILENT_POLLS polls gives way to the chip's own search.
 *
 * The polls only make contact when the tables hold rows this car answers.
 * They do not when the tables are empty, and they do not when the device
 * was moved between an OBD-II car and a UDS-dialect one (ISO 27145 /
 * SAE J1979-2), whose rows mean nothing to each other. So while there is no
 * contact a probe goes out every AP_PROBE_GAP_US (doubling up to
 * AP_PROBE_GAP_MAX_US while nothing answers):
 *
 *   a protocol named by the     the bitmap request of the stored car's
 *   setting or the store        dialect; under a PINNED setting the other
 *                               dialect too (there is no search to fall
 *                               back to)
 *   no such protocol, or it     a walk over the ISO 15765-4 protocols the
 *   stayed silent               bus guard allows for this bus, `0100` and
 *                               `22F400` on each (ap_dialect_can_candidates
 *                               has the reasons: the chip's own search
 *                               cannot find a UDS-dialect vehicle and takes
 *                               9.3 s to say so)
 *
 * A J1939 network (phase 5) is heard, not asked: once the chip's probe found
 * nobody, the listener's sources and VIN are the sighting (j1939_contact). A
 * stored J1939 vehicle gives the listener a ten second head start, so a
 * truck's boot sends no OBD request at all; the VIN broadcast gets the same
 * time before an identity without it, and one heard later is still adopted
 * (j1939_vin_watch).
 *
 * Never touches flash: the store hands every write to its worker.
