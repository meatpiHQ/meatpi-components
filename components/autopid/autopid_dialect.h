/**
 * @file autopid_dialect.h
 * @brief The OBD dialect part of autopid_private.h (pure, host-tested:
 *        autopid_dialect.c). A FRAGMENT: included by autopid_private.h
 *        only, after autopid_vehicle.h (it needs ap_dialect_t,
 *        ap_veh_ecu_t and ap_bus_t).
 *
 * The legislated diagnostics of a vehicle come in dialects: the same data
 * behind other requests.
 *
 *   obd2   SAE J1979 / ISO 15031-5, services 01..0A: `0100` support
 *          bitmaps, `01xx` PIDs, the VIN by `0902`.
 *   uds    ISO 27145 (WWH-OBD) and SAE J1979-2 (OBD on UDS): the same PIDs
 *          as data identifiers F4xx of service 22 (`22F40C` answers
 *          `62 F4 0C A B`), the VIN by `22F802`, eight bitmap ranges. Such
 *          a vehicle does not answer `0100` at all.
 *   j1939  SAE J1939: broadcast data, no request rows (TASK_j1939_wwh.md
 *          phase 5).
 *
 * Which dialect a car speaks is found by the detection job and kept per
 * car in the vehicle store.
