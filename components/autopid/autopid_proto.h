/**
 * @file autopid_proto.h
 * @brief The vehicle protocols the OBD chip speaks, as ONE table (pure,
 *        host-tested): the ELM number, the name a person reads, the kind of
 *        bus, the pins, the bit rate, how a reply is framed, and what it
 *        costs to start the bus and to keep it.
 *
 * Until 2026-11-12 the firmware knew the four ISO 15765-4 CAN protocols and
 * kept what it knew in separate maps (the setting's enum, the prelude, the
 * bus guard's bit rates, the 29-bit rule, the page's names). The pre-CAN
 * protocols (J1850 PWM and VPW, ISO 9141-2, ISO 14230-4) come in through
 * this table: the setting, the prelude, the reply layout, the detection's
 * walk and GET /api/autopid/protocols read it.
