# WiCAN Pro: BLE GATT interface reference

> The on-air contract for third-party apps (Android / iOS / desktop), the
> BLE counterpart of `components/HTTP_API.md`: anyone can build their own
> app, there is no privileged client. Byte-exact with the legacy WiCAN
> Pro firmware for the four original characteristics, so existing apps
> keep working unchanged; the 2026-09-21 firmware APPENDS stream channels
> that carry the whole HTTP API (`ble_http`) and SAE J2534 PassThru
> (`ble_j2534`) over BLE. Facts below come from the implementation
> (`ble_manager_gatt_svc.c`, `ble_manager_gatt_nimble.c`,
> `ble_manager_channel.c`) and are verified on air against BlueZ/bleak by
> the benches in `tools/testbench/ble/` (working client code to crib from).

## 1. Discovery

| | |
|---|---|
| Advertised name | `WiC_<device_id>`: `device_id` = 12 lowercase hex (SoftAP MAC), e.g. `WiC_14c19f44e349` (legacy ble_uid format; serial 2A25 = name+7 = last 9 hex) |
| Advertised service UUID | `0000FFF0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB` (128-bit, complete list) |
| Advertising interval | 160 ms, general discoverable, connectable |
| Advertising sets | `advertising` setting (2026-09-21): `legacy` (default) = the 4.2 ADV_IND set above (flags + TX power + the FFF0 UUID; name + `MeatPi` manufacturer data in the scan response), `extended` = one BLE 5 extended PDU carrying flags + UUID + name + `MeatPi` (connectable, primary PHY 1M, secondary PHY per `phy`; 4.2-only scanners do NOT see it), `both` = the two sets at once (the same device shows up as two advertising reports; the legacy set keeps every existing app working) |
| PHY | `phy` setting: `1m` (default, the 4.2 behaviour), `2m`, `coded`, `auto`. The device asks for the PHY right after connect; the central decides (section 6) |
| Address | **Resolvable private address** (rotates). Scan by NAME or the advertised service UUID, never by a hard-coded MAC (a bonded central resolves it to the identity address and may then connect directly) |
| TX power | `tx_power_dbm` setting (default 9 dBm) |

BLE is **disabled by default** (`ble_manager.enabled = false`): the user
enables it via `/api/settings/ble_manager` (reboot to apply). Advertising
stops while a client is connected (one central at a time) and resumes on
disconnect.

**Feature detection is by discovery.** Which characteristics exist depends
on the device's settings (section 3.2, column "present when"): an app
enumerates the FFF0 service and uses what it finds instead of assuming.

## 2. Pairing and security

- **LE Secure Connections + MITM**, device role DisplayOnly: the phone
  prompts for a **6-digit passkey**, default `123456`, the `passkey`
  setting. **The central starts the pairing** on its first encrypted
  access (every phone does this on the *Insufficient Authentication*
  answer). Until 2026-09-21 the device also sent an LL Security Request
  right after connect; it no longer does, because that peripheral-driven
  start made **Windows** begin a system pairing that a desktop app's own
  ceremony could not join (WinRT custom pairing failed with no ceremony
  asked). A Windows app pairs with `DevicePairingKinds.ProvidePin` and
  answers the request with the passkey (`ble_phy_pc.py` is the reference).
- **Every** characteristic requires an **encrypted + authenticated** link
  (`ENC` + `AUTHEN` on reads and writes, incl. Device Info): an unpaired
  connection can discover the layout but read or write nothing (answered
  *Insufficient Authentication*, which prompts pairing).
- **Bonding** (`bonding` setting, default true): the pairing exchanges
  long-term keys so a paired phone reconnects **without re-entering the
  passkey**, and the keys are **persisted to NVS** across reboots and
  power cycles. Off = the link is still encrypted + MITM-protected every
  session but nothing reusable is kept; every reconnect re-pairs. Up to 3
  bonded phones; a 4th evicts the oldest.
- **Secure Connections only** (`sc_only`, default true): refuses a peer
  that tries to downgrade to LE legacy pairing. Every phone since ~2014
  does SC; turn off only for a genuinely pre-4.2 accessory.
- **Pairing window**: `pairing_at_boot` (default true) opens the window at
  boot; firmware can close it at runtime (`ble_manager_pairing_enable()`
  / `ble_manager_pairing_disable()`). Closed = NEW pairings are rejected;
  a reconnect by an already-bonded phone is unaffected.
- **Bond loss recovery**: the device keeps its bond across reboots; after
  a **re-flash / factory reset** (clears NVS) the phone must Forget/Remove
  the device and re-pair, else its stale bond fails at service discovery
  with an immediate disconnect. The device handles the reverse (phone
  re-pairs, device drops its stale entry).
- **GATT table growth (2026-09-21)**: the stream channels are appended
  after the four legacy characteristics, so FFF1/FFF2/CLI keep their
  attribute handles and an app with a cached database keeps working. It
  will not SEE FFF3..FFF6 until it re-discovers. iOS caches aggressively:
  if discovery shows only the old table after a firmware update, Forget
  This Device and pair again. Android: clear the app's cached
  characteristics (a fresh `connectGatt` after `createBond`, or call the
  hidden `refresh()`). Linux/BlueZ: `bluetoothctl remove <identity>`
  (the cache held FFF3 as "notify" from an older build and StartNotify
  then failed with NotSupported, 2026-09-21). The device does not send a
  Service Changed indication across reboots in this version.

## 3. GATT services

### 3.1 Device Information: `0x180A` (read-only)

Values are served with their **historical lengths**: strings include the
NUL terminator, the serial is space-padded to 32 bytes. Trim trailing
`\0` / spaces before comparing.

| Characteristic | UUID | Value (bytes on air) |
|---|---|---|
| Manufacturer Name | `0x2A29` | `MEATPI.COM\0` (11) |
| Model Number | `0x2A24` | `WiCAN-PRO\0` (10) |
| Serial Number | `0x2A25` | `<device_id minus its FIRST hex char>` space-padded to 32, e.g. id `14c19f44e349` gives `4c19f44e349` + 21 spaces (legacy `name+7` quirk, kept byte-exact) |
| Hardware Revision | `0x2A27` | `1_53         \0` (14) |
| Firmware Revision | `0x2A26` | `400\0` (4) |
| Software Revision | `0x2A28` | `0000\0` (5) |
| System ID | `0x2A23` | 8 x `0x00` |
| IEEE Reg. Cert. | `0x2A2A` | 8 x `0x00` |

### 3.2 Data, CLI and stream channels: `0xFFF0`

All 16-bit UUIDs below sit on the Bluetooth base
(`0000xxxx-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`). Odd = device to app (notify),
even = app to device (write).

| Characteristic | UUID | Properties | Direction | Present when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Data OUT** | `0xFFF1` | notify, indicate (read returns one dummy `0x00`) | device to app | always |
| **Data IN** | `0xFFF2` | write, write-without-response | app to device | always |
| **CLI OUT** | `0200DEC0-01EF-BC9A-5678-1234DEADF0BE` | notify, indicate (read = dummy) | device to app | always |
| **CLI IN** | `0300DEC0-01EF-BC9A-5678-1234DEADF0BE` | write, write-without-response | app to device | always |
| **HTTP OUT** | `0xFFF3` | **notify, indicate** (read = dummy): your CCCD picks the mode, see 4.3 | device to app | `ble_http.enabled` (default true) |
| **HTTP IN** | `0xFFF4` | write, write-without-response | app to device | `ble_http.enabled` |
| **J2534 OUT** | `0xFFF5` | **indicate** (read = dummy) | device to app | `j2534_server.enabled` (default false) |
| **J2534 IN** | `0xFFF6` | write, write-without-response | app to device | `j2534_server.enabled` |

Subscribe (write the CCCD, i.e. `setNotifyValue` / `enableNotifications`)
to an OUT characteristic before expecting anything back on it. On a
stream channel the CCCD value is a choice (since 2026-09-22): **`0x0002`
indications** = every PDU confirmed by your stack before the next one,
no client-side flow control, slow; **`0x0001` notifications** (FFF3 only)
= the radio's full rate, and the channel's protocol then requires you to
send credits and to check its frame counter (`BLE_HTTP_PROTOCOL.md` 4b).
`ENABLE_INDICATION_VALUE` / `ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_VALUE` on Android; iOS
`setNotifyValue(true)` and BlueZ pick notifications when the property is
offered, so on FFF3 they are in notify mode. FFF5 (J2534) stays
indicate-only. `GET /api/ble` `channels[].out` shows which mode the device
is in. The legacy data pipe (FFF1) keeps plain notifications for the ELM
dialect, which tolerates a drop. All writes carry `WRITE_ENC |
WRITE_AUTHEN`; the device additionally refuses writes in software until
the link is secured.

## 4. The data pipe (FFF2 to device to FFF1)

A transparent **byte stream**, no framing added by BLE. What sits on the
other end is a `bridge_manager` configuration: out of the box the OBD
chip is bridged to WebSocket (`ws_obd`), so pairing BLE with OBD means
setting `bridges` to `{"name":"br_ble","a":"obd","b":"ble"}` via
`/api/settings/bridge_manager` (the single-consumer rule: `obd` feeds one
bridge at a time). `{"a":"can","b":"ble","translator":"slcan"}` gives
Lawicel slcan over BLE instead.

With the OBD bridge active the dialect is **ELM327/STN ASCII**:

```
app writes  FFF2: "ATI\r"
app notified FFF1: "ELM327 v2.3\r\r>"      <- accumulate until '>' at line start
app writes  FFF2: "0100\r"
app notified FFF1: "41 00 FF FF FF FF \r\r>"
```

- **Notification payload cap**: `min(490, MTU - 3)` bytes (section 6).
- A logical reply may span several notifications: reassemble by the
  dialect's terminator (`>` for ELM), never by packet boundaries.
- App-to-device writes are capped at 490 bytes per write (larger ones are
  rejected with an ATT error): chunk to `<= MTU - 3`.

### 4.1 Dialects available on the data pipe

The pipe carries whatever the configured bridge row puts on it. Every row
is `{"name","a","b":"ble","translator"}` in `/api/settings/bridge_manager`
(reboot to apply; the `ble` jack feeds ONE bridge at a time):

| Row (`a`, `translator`) | Bytes per CAN frame | Dialect | For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `obd`, `raw` | ASCII lines | ELM327/STN over the OBD chip (section 4) | Car Scanner, Torque, any ELM app |
| `can`, `slcan` | 22 to 27 | Lawicel slcan ASCII (`tIIIL DD..\r`, `TIIIIIIIIL..\r`) | slcan tools, `ble_slcan_bridge_test.py` |
| `can`, `gvret` | 20 | SavvyCAN GVRET binary (`F1 00 ts:4 id:4 dlc data xor`), with the handshake answered by the device | SavvyCAN relays |
| `can`, `realdash` | 20 | RealDash `66 33 22 11 id:4 data:8 crc32:4` | RealDash |
| **`can`, `raw`** | **10 + dlc (10 to 18)** | **the timestamped binary CAN record below** | your own app: the most compact stream the device offers, with bus time |

### 4.2 The binary CAN record (`can <-raw-> ble`)

```
off 0  u32 LE  CAN identifier (11-bit or 29-bit)
off 4  u8      flags: bit0 = extended (29-bit) id, bit1 = RTR; other bits 0
off 5  u8      dlc (0..8)
off 6  u32 LE  ts_us: receive time in microseconds since device boot, taken
               in the CAN receive interrupt; wraps every 71.6 min (compute
               deltas modulo 2^32); 0 = not available
off 10 dlc B   data (absent when RTR or dlc 0)
```

One record per CAN frame, 10 to 18 bytes, device to app AND app to device
(write a record to FFF2 and the frame goes on the bus; set `ts_us` to 0,
the device ignores it). The timestamp is the device's bus-side time, so
inter-frame timing survives BLE's batching and jitter: use it for logging,
replay and signal-period analysis; the phone's receive time is only good
for live displays. Records are packed back to back into notifications up
to the payload cap and a record MAY straddle two notifications: parse a
byte stream by `10 + dlc`, never one record per packet. Sanity rules a
parser should enforce: `dlc <= 8`, `flags & ~3 == 0`, `id <= 0x7FF` unless
extended, `ts_us` non-decreasing modulo 2^32 within a session.

Worked example, the ECU's `0100` answer received 1.234567 s after boot
(one 18-byte record as it appears inside an FFF1 notification):

```
E8 07 00 00   id 0x7E8 (u32 LE)
00            flags: 11-bit, data frame
08            dlc 8
87 D6 12 00   ts_us 0x0012D687 = 1234567 us
06 41 00 18 3F 80 03 00   data
```

A 29-bit frame `18DB33F1 [02 01 00]` written BY the app to FFF2 (ts 0):

```
F1 33 DB 18   id 0x18DB33F1
01            flags: extended
03            dlc 3
00 00 00 00   ts_us 0 (the device ignores it on the way to the bus)
02 01 00      data
```

Python: `struct.pack("<IBBI", can_id, flags, dlc, 0) + data` to build,
`struct.unpack_from("<IBBI", buf)` then `buf[10:10+dlc]` to parse.
Kotlin: `ByteBuffer.wrap(bytes).order(LITTLE_ENDIAN)`; Swift:
`withUnsafeBytes { $0.load(fromByteOffset:as:) }` with `UInt32(littleEndian:)`.

Delivery on this pipe is
by notification (the ELM/slcan contract): under a flood the device drops
whole records at its TX queue (`br_ble_can` `stats` on `/api/bridges`,
`tx queue full` in its log) rather than blocking the bus, so a CAN
monitor app must tolerate gaps; a lost notification can also cost the
tail of a straddling record, which the sanity rules above catch (skip one
byte and re-sync). Bench 2026-09-21 (`ble_can_raw_pi.py`, row `br_ble_can`
= `can` / `raw`, UB500 central, WiFi STA up): the pre-timestamp layout
ran at exactly 14.0 bytes per record with 0 malformed and 0 straddling
records over 88 notifications, 20 of 20 `7DF 0100` requests answered from
`7E8` with a p50 of 176 ms request-to-record, a 29-bit record on the bus;
the timestamped layout's run is in `TESTING.md` (row `blecanraw`). The record format is frozen
with this version (`can_manager/include/can_frame_wire.h`); any change
would be a new translator name, never a silent edit.

### 4.3 Stream channels: shared conventions (FFF3..FFF6)

The HTTP and J2534 characteristics are **stream channels**: each pair is
one reliable, in-order byte stream in each direction and nothing more.
The protocol carried on it (documented by its owner) frames itself with a
length-prefixed header.

- A frame may span several ATT writes or notifications, and one unit may
  hold the tail of one frame and the head of the next. **Reassemble by
  the protocol's length field, never by unit size.**
- Write in units of at most `min(490, MTU - 3)` bytes; PDUs from the
  device are at most that size too. On **indications** one is in flight
  at a time (your stack confirms each before the next arrives; the device
  waits up to the ATT indication timeout, 30 s, because a stack confirms
  only after the writes it has already queued went out). On
  **notifications** (FFF3 with CCCD `0x0001`) the controller packs
  several PDUs per connection event and the owner protocol carries the
  flow control and a per-frame counter, because a stack CAN drop a PDU it
  already accepted: measured 2026-09-21/22 on the device (the host counted
  notifications that never reached the air; the controller's ACL TX buffer
  allocation from a starved heap, fixed in the firmware with static
  buffers) and on a Pi (BlueZ's D-Bus notification path). Indications are
  acknowledged end to end;
  notifications are 2x-10x faster and every loss is detected by the
  counter, so the app repeats the request.
- Write-without-response is fastest but has no acknowledgement; the
  device's receive buffer per channel is finite (HTTP 16 KB, J2534
  9 KB). Either use write-with-response, or honour the owner protocol's
  flow-control rule (HTTP: `CREDIT` frames; J2534: at most one request
  pipelined beyond the outstanding one).
- Bytes written before the link is secured are rejected; bytes left over
  when a link drops are discarded, never delivered to the next central.
- One central at a time; one request in flight per channel.
- On a protocol error the device ends the exchange (HTTP: an error
  response; J2534: the session) rather than guessing; reconnect to reset
  everything.

Reassembly pseudo-code (J2534 header shown; HTTP is the same idea with an
8-byte header, `BLE_HTTP_PROTOCOL.md` section 7):

```python
buf = bytearray()
def on_notify(chunk):
    buf.extend(chunk)
    while len(buf) >= 12:
        magic, ver, mtype, seq, ch, length = struct.unpack_from("<HBBHHI", buf)
        if magic != 0x4A35: raise ProtocolError        # disconnect + reconnect
        if len(buf) < 12 + length: return              # wait for the rest
        frame = bytes(buf[:12 + length]); del buf[:12 + length]
        deliver(mtype, seq, ch, frame[12:])
```

### 4.4 The HTTP API over BLE (FFF4 in, FFF3 out)

Every route in `components/HTTP_API.md` is reachable from a paired phone:
the app sends a small JSON request head plus an optional streamed body,
the device replays it against its own web server and streams the status,
content type and body back. That is how a BLE app manages **storage**
(`/api/fs/list|info|upload|download|file|mkdir`, internal flash and the
SD card), **settings** (`/api/settings/...` + `submit`), **status and
logs**, the **UDS terminal** (`/api/uds/request`, `/api/uds/session`),
**AutoPID**, **scripts** and **OTA**. Contract, framing, credits, errors
and byte-exact examples: `ble_http/BLE_HTTP_PROTOCOL.md`. Bench and
reference client: `tools/testbench/ble/ble_http_pi.py`.

### 4.5 J2534 PassThru over BLE (FFF6 in, FFF5 out)

The same SAE J2534 wire protocol the Windows DLL speaks over TCP and USB
CDC-ACM, carried as a byte stream: HELLO / OPEN / CONNECT (CAN,
ISO15765) / WRITE_MSGS / filters / periodic messages / unsolicited
RX_MSG. Present only while `j2534_server.enabled` is true. One tester
across all transports: a PC tool attached over TCP makes a BLE tester's
first frame answer `ERR_DEVICE_IN_USE`, and the other way round.
`/api/j2534` reports `transport:"ble"` during a BLE session; the
Exclusive-bus rule (AutoPID off the bus) and the reflash gate apply
unchanged. Full specification: `j2534_server/J2534_WIRE_PROTOCOL.md`
(section 8.3 = the BLE binding). Reference client:
`tools/testbench/ble/ble_j2534_pi.py`.

## 5. The CLI pipe (CLI IN to device to CLI OUT)

The full WiCAN command line (same registry as UART/WebSocket; commands in
`cmdline_manager/README.md`):

- Write ASCII **lines** terminated `\n` or `\r` to CLI IN (partial writes
  fine, the device reassembles; 1024-byte line max).
- The response streams as CLI OUT notifications and **ends with the
  `wican> ` prompt**: that is the "command done" marker.
- One command at a time device-wide (a mutex serialises all surfaces);
  lines are queued to the command dispatcher, never run inside the BLE
  stack.
- Keep to short-running commands from BLE (status/info reads are the
  intended use). `blehttp` and `j2534` print the two channels' status.

## 6. Connection behaviour an app MUST expect

- **WiFi hands over to you** (interface_manager, default rules ON): while
  your app is connected over BLE the device **suspends WiFi STA/AP**; it
  drops off the LAN and its HTTP API is unreachable over WiFi until you
  disconnect (resumes automatically a few seconds later). "User connects
  phone = user is in the car" is the product behaviour, and it gives BLE a
  clean radio (measured notify throughput ~77 KB/s). The HTTP API itself
  stays available to you through the BLE tunnel (4.4). Conversely a
  station on the WiCAN's own AP stops BLE (`ap_ble_exclusive`).
- **MTU**: the device prefers **517**. Android must request it
  (`requestMtu(517)`) right after connecting, before discovery; iOS
  negotiates on its own (185 on older devices, up to 512 on recent
  ones). The notification cap follows the negotiated MTU:
  `min(490, MTU - 3)`. Never depend on a particular packet size.
- **Connection parameters**: the device requests a window per the
  `conn_profile` setting: `ios` (default) 20-40 ms interval,
  `android_fast` 7.5-15 ms (halves command RTT on Android; iOS ignores
  out-of-policy requests, hence the default). Measured CLI round trip
  ~75 ms p50 on the default profile.
- **One central at a time**; advertising (every configured set) resumes
  on disconnect.
- **PHY** (BLE 5, 2026-09-21): the `phy` setting is the device's PHY
  preference, set as the controller default: `1m` (default) answers any
  central's PHY request with 1M only, so the link **stays on 1M** even
  with a 5.0 central that asks for 2M on its own (PC Intel adapters do);
  `2m` / `coded` / `auto` make the controller start the PHY switch right
  after the connection, and the central answers with what it supports (a
  4.2 phone keeps 1M). Result: `I ble_manager: PHY now tx 2M rx 2M`,
  `GET /api/ble` `phy_tx`/`phy_rx` (1/2/3 = 1M/2M/coded). An app can also
  request a PHY itself (Android `setPreferredPhy`; iOS decides alone).
  Nothing in the GATT contract changes with the PHY, only the on-air time
  per packet. Measured (`TESTING.md` row `blephy`, PC Intel adapter, WiFi
  handed over): write-without-response uploads run at 40-50 KB/s on
  either PHY, while indication-paced downloads (one 490 B indication per
  round trip) and command round trips are bounded by the connection
  interval, not the PHY. Downloads on notifications (protocol v2) scale
  with the PHY like uploads do (`TESTING.md` row `blethru`). Known central limit: the TP-Link UB500
  (RTL8761BU) drops a 2M link with the ESP32-S3 at the first 2M
  connection event (both sides time out); keep `1m` for that adapter.
- **Flow control**: the device retries a notification for up to 2 s when
  the radio credits are exhausted (a slow phone throttles a transfer
  instead of losing data); a burst it cannot absorb on FFF2 is counted
  and dropped, which the ELM dialect tolerates. On the stream channels a
  notification is retried up to 30 s (the same budget as an indication)
  and the HTTP tunnel keeps at most 16 KB unacknowledged by the app's
  `CREDIT` frames.
- Do not force LL data-length extension from a central that lets you:
  long LL packets destabilise the link under WiFi coex (measured, see
  `ble_manager_gatt_nimble.c`).

## 6b. Platform notes

- **Which OUT mode you get on FFF3 (measured 2026-09-22):** Android apps
  write the CCCD themselves (`ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_VALUE` = the fast path,
  `ENABLE_INDICATION_VALUE` = confirmed PDUs, no credits); iOS
  `setNotifyValue(true)` and BlueZ (`StartNotify`, `AcquireNotify`) pick
  NOTIFICATIONS when offered; Windows through bleak/WinRT picks INDICATIONS
  and refuses a direct CCCD write ("Cannot write to CCCD directly"), so a
  bleak client on Windows runs the slow path (5.6 KB/s at its 45 ms
  interval) while a native WinRT app can choose with
  `WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync(Notify)`. Read
  `GET /api/ble` `channels[].out` when in doubt.

**Android (BluetoothGatt)**

- `connectGatt(..., TRANSPORT_LE)`, then `requestMtu(517)`, then
  `discoverServices()`.
- Pairing: let the first encrypted operation raise the system passkey
  dialog, or call `device.createBond()` first; the passkey is the
  device's `passkey` setting.
- Enable notifications with `setCharacteristicNotification(ch, true)`
  AND write the CCCD descriptor `0x2902` = `ENABLE_NOTIFICATION_VALUE`.
- Throughput: `WRITE_TYPE_NO_RESPONSE` for body/data writes. Only one
  GATT operation may be outstanding: wait for `onCharacteristicWrite`
  before the next write (API 33+: check the return code of
  `writeCharacteristic(ch, bytes, type)`).
- After a firmware update that grew the GATT table, bond again if the
  new characteristics are missing (section 2).

**iOS (CoreBluetooth)**

- Chunk writes to `peripheral.maximumWriteValueLength(for:
  .withoutResponse)`; gate them on `canSendWriteWithoutResponse` /
  `peripheralIsReady(toSendWriteWithoutResponse:)`.
- The pairing prompt appears on the first encrypted read or write
  (Insufficient Authentication), not at connect: read a Device Info
  characteristic first to trigger it deliberately.
- `setNotifyValue(true, for:)` on the OUT characteristics.
- iOS caches the GATT database per bond: Forget This Device after a
  firmware update if FFF3..FFF6 do not appear.

**Linux / BlueZ (bleak, desktop tools)**

- Subscribe with `AcquireNotify` (bleak: `start_notify(..., use_notify_acquire=True)`),
  not the default `StartNotify`: the D-Bus PropertiesChanged path dropped
  whole 490-byte notifications at 8 KB/s on the bench Pi (device counters
  65730 B sent vs 63770 B received, no device-side timeouts, 2026-09-21).
  The acquired socket keeps every one.
- After a fresh `pair()` the service collection can be stale: reconnect
  once bonded. Bonded devices do not show up in a scan (the RPA resolves
  to the identity address): connect to that address directly.

`android_fast`), and since descriptor v4 (2026-09-21) `phy` (`1m` |
`2m` | `coded` | `auto`, default `1m`) and `advertising` (`legacy` |
`extended` | `both`, default `legacy`): the defaults are byte-for-byte
the 4.2 behaviour, so a stored v3 config migrates by filling the
defaults. `GET /api/ble` mirrors both settings and the live link's
`phy_tx`/`phy_rx`. `/api/settings/ble_http`: `enabled` (true), `cli`.
`/api/settings/j2534_server`: `enabled` (false) gates the J2534 channel,
`exclusive`, `allow_reflash`. `/api/settings/interface_manager`
(`sta_ble_handover`, `ap_ble_exclusive`) for the WiFi behaviour in 6.

## 8. Reference clients

`tools/testbench/ble/ble_bench.py` (pairing agent + echo + CLI),
`ble_ab.py` (device info + CLI RTT + pipes), `ble_blast.py` (throughput
counting), `ble_slcan_bridge_test.py` (slcan over the data pipe),
`ble_http_pi.py` (the HTTP tunnel incl. storage and UDS legs),
`ble_j2534_pi.py` (PassThru): bench-proven Python/bleak implementations
of everything above, including the passkey agent, identity-address
reconnects and frame reassembly.

## 9. Document ownership

This file owns the GATT contract (services, characteristics, UUIDs,
properties, security, MTU and chunking rules) and the stream-channel
registry table in 3.2. A component that registers a channel or changes
the bytes on one updates 3.2 and its own protocol document in the same
commit (`MEATPI_COMPONENT_STANDARD.md` 6c). Characteristics are only ever
appended within the FFF0 service so bonded clients' cached handles stay
valid.
