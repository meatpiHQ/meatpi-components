/**
 * @file can_isotp_esp.h
 * @brief The public build's native ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) provider.
 *
 * Implements can_manager's provider slot (can_isotp.h) with the vendored
 * esp_isotp stack in externally-managed mode: can_manager keeps the TWAI
 * node, this component subscribes a frame queue on each session's rx id,
 * one task feeds the frames to the stack and drives its state machine,
 * and the stack's TX frames go out through can_manager_send(). Sessions
 * coexist with every other bus client (monitor, autopid on the MIC chip,
 * bridges): only frames on a session's rx id are consumed by it.
 *
 * Consumers (uds_manager's "isotp" transport, the J2534 ISO15765 channel)
 * keep using can_isotp() and know nothing about this component. A build
 * that carries an add-on pack with its own provider wins the slot: main
 * calls can_isotp_esp_init() AFTER ext_manager_init and it registers
 * only when the slot is still empty.
 *
 * Limits (esp_isotp 0.1.1): the flow control THIS side sends as receiver
 * uses the Kconfig defaults (BS 8, STmin 1 ms), can_isotp_cfg_t's
 * block_size/stmin_ms are accepted and ignored; N_Bs/N_Cr are the Kconfig
 * response timeout (100 ms); one PDU is at most CAN_ISOTP_ESP_MAX_PDU
 * bytes (SAE J2534's 4128); at most 5 sessions (1 UDS + 4 J2534 channels).
