 * @brief The TWAI node driver half of can_core (esp_driver_twai node API,
 *        port 2026-07-21): the ISR callbacks that copy every frame into a
 *        static raw queue, and the node's creation. Split out of can_core.c
 *        2026-10-02 (700-line rule); the start on the configured ISR core,
 *        the stop and the handle's lock are in can_core_node.c since
 *        2026-10-05.

 * A controller listening at a bitrate close to the bus's (83.3 against 95.2
 * kbit/s, 95.2 against 100) sees a bit error every few bit times and raises
 * a bus-error interrupt for each: tens of thousands a second. The level-1
 * dispatcher serves the interrupt that re-asserts fastest first, so the
 * tick starves and the interrupt watchdog resets the chip (caught on the
 * console 2026-10-03 16:31:00 during the autobaud bench's walk from 83 to 95
 * kbit/s: core 0 idle, `_xt_lowint1` busy for 300 ms; two such resets in
 * five runs before that). Nothing at task level can help: the task never
 * runs. So the error ISR counts errors per window and, past the storm
 * threshold, MASKS the controller's interrupts (twai_ll_set_enabled_intrs:
 * the register, not the driver). The node is deaf from then on, which the
 * link policy already handles (link_look_at_the_line: a busy RX line with a
 * controller that says nothing = mismatch evidence) by bouncing the node,
 * and every bounce starts a new node with its interrupts on. */

 *  retried for ever on a dead bus parks the node error-passive, then
 *  bus-off. The two are told apart by the arb_lost error event the HAL
