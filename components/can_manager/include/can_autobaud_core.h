/**
 * @file can_autobaud_core.h
 * @brief Listen before talk: the bitrate and mode policy of the native CAN
 *        node (pure logic, host-testable).
 *
 * A node at the wrong bitrate destroys the traffic of the bus it sits on
 * (bench 2026-10-02: the sending ECU driven to bus-off again and again). So
 * the node ALWAYS starts listen-only, which the driver makes physically
 * unable to transmit (TX pin not routed), and this policy decides what
 * happens next from two counters:
 *
 *   frames  frames received (CRC-checked: they prove the bitrate)
 *   bad     receive errors (stuff / form / CRC seen while listening): what
 *           a wrong bitrate produces, thousands per second, with no frame
 *
 *   frames arrive                     -> the bitrate is proven; a node the
 *                                        settings want talking is promoted
 *                                        to normal mode
 *   errors and no frame               -> wrong bitrate: next candidate
 *                                        (auto) or MISMATCH (fixed), still
 *                                        listen-only, still harmless
 *   nothing at all for a while        -> silent bus (a gatewayed OBD port):
 *                                        a FIXED bitrate goes to its
 *                                        configured mode, as before; auto
 *                                        keeps listening (a silent bus has
 *                                        no bitrate)
 *   running in normal mode, then
 *   errors and no frame               -> demoted to listen-only at once (the
 *                                        bus woke up at another bitrate)
 *
 * "Errors and no frame" is taken at once from a node that talks (every
 * error there is a frame it destroyed). A node that listens waits for a
 * second helping CAN_AB_CONFIRM_MS later: it can afford to, and a single
 * corrupted frame must not read as a wrong bitrate.
 *
 * After a mismatch was seen once, silence no longer promotes: only frames do.
 * All times are uint32 milliseconds; comparisons are wrap-safe. The caller
 * steps the policy from one task and applies the returned action.
