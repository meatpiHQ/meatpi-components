/**
 * @file can_isotp.h
 * @brief ISO-TP (ISO 15765-2) session provider slot on the shared bus.
 *
 * can_manager owns the native-CAN bus but not an ISO-TP stack; an
 * add-on component pack registers one here (ext init phase, see
 * ext_manager.h). Consumers — uds_manager's "isotp" transport, the
 * J2534 ISO15765 channel — fetch the ops with can_isotp() and treat a
 * NULL return as "not available in this build" (they degrade with a
 * log line; UDS falls back to the obd_chip transport).
 *
 * Provider contract:
 *   - Sessions coexist with normal CAN monitoring: only frames matching
 *     the session's rx_id are consumed by the ISO-TP stack, everything
 *     else keeps flowing to the other bus clients.
 *   - open() fails with ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE while the bus is down.
 *   - recv() returns ESP_OK (+*len), ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT (nothing arrived
 *     within timeout_ms), or ESP_ERR_NO_MEM (the reassembled message
 *     was larger than @p cap and has been CONSUMED — callers use this
 *     to drain stale traffic).
 *   - send() blocks the full transfer (segmentation + flow control);
 *     ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT when the peer's flow control never arrives.
