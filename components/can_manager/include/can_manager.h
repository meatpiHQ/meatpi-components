/**
 * @file can_manager.h
 * @brief Owner of the native CAN (TWAI) bus — WiCAN Pro TX=GPIO2 /
 *        RX=GPIO1 / STDBY=GPIO38.
 *
 * Model (ARCHITECTURE "the one pattern"): can_manager owns the ONE
 * physical CAN peripheral through a single shared `can_core` handle;
 * every consumer REGISTERS into it instead of touching the driver:
 *   - registered bus clients with their own filter/mask (add-on jacks),
 *   - task-owned RX queues (drop-oldest fan-out) via
 *     can_manager_subscribe_queue(),
 *   - plain TX via can_manager_send().
 *
 * Settings ("can_manager", reboot-to-apply): enabled (default false),
 * baud (kbit/s enum or "auto"), silent (listen-only for good), cli.
 *
 * Listen before talk (2026-10-02): a node at the wrong bitrate destroys the
 * bus traffic, in listen-only mode too on this chip, so the node always
 * starts WITHOUT its TX pin and gets it only once frames prove the bitrate
 * (or a fixed-bitrate bus stayed silent). Until then, and on a mismatch,
 * can_manager_send() refuses. can_manager_status() tells where the link is.
 *
 * The ESP TWAI transceiver and the MIC3624 OBD chip are two nodes on the
 * SAME vehicle CAN bus — electrically legal; contention between autopid
 * polling (via the MIC) and native-CAN traffic is a policy question left
 * to the user in v1 (README).
