/**
 * @file cmdline_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN command line owner (service component; rewrite of the
 *        legacy `cmdline`).
 *
 * ONE command REGISTRY + dispatcher (esp_console underneath). The
 * manager owns NO commands except `help` — every component registers
 * its own via cmdline_manager_register() (the same ownership inversion
 * as settings/log/http registration; shape follows IDF's
 * examples/system/console per-domain register_*() convention).
 *
 * Reachable over every transport WITHOUT transport code here:
 *
 *  - The component exposes the firmware's standard chunk-endpoint face
 *    (`subscribe`/`send` — the OBD/BLE/WS convention), so TCP, UDP and
 *    WebSocket consoles are CONFIGURED BRIDGES: `br_x = cli <-> ws_cli`
 *    (or a socket_manager server) in settings, zero code.
 *  - BLE: main glues ble_manager's CLI characteristics to
 *    `cmdline_manager_exec_line_async()` (the legacy BLE console) —
 *    async because the lines arrive on the NimBLE host task, which
 *    must never run a command inline (a long command wedges the BLE
 *    stack: GATT "Unlikely Error" on the link).
 *  - UART0: a linenoise console on the log UART (settings-gated) —
 *    line editing, history, tab completion, dumb-terminal fallback
 *    (the IDF advanced console example pattern; NOT the REPL component,
 *    whose internal loop would bypass the one-command-at-a-time lock).
 *
 * Commands print through `cmdline_printf()`/`cmdline_write()` (routed
 * to the invoking transport); responses end with the legacy `wican> `
 * prompt.
