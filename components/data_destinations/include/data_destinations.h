/**
 * @file data_destinations.h
 * @brief Data destinations: cyclic delivery of the live AutoPID
 *        parameter set to MQTT topics, HTTP/HTTPS endpoints and the ABRP
 *        (Iternio) telemetry API (feature component).
 *
 * The v6 home of the legacy autopid "destinations" (v4.51p
 * `group_destination_t`): up to DATA_DESTINATIONS_MAX entries, each with
 * its own type, cycle, auth (bearer / API key header or query / basic),
 * extra query parameters, certificate set (cert_manager) and enable
 * switch. One poster task (PSRAM stack) walks the table every second,
 * publishes what is due, tracks per-destination success/failure counters
 * and applies exponential backoff to a failing endpoint so a dead server
 * or a lost link never turns into a request storm.
 *
 * Payloads (legacy on-wire shapes, so existing receivers keep working):
 *  - MQTT: the flat `{"Name": value, ..., "timestamp": epoch}` snapshot
 *    (retained by default), `~/topic` expands to `<mqtt prefix>/topic`;
 *  - HTTP/HTTPS: the FIRST successful push carries
 *    `{"config": <PID tables>, "status": {...}, "autopid_data": {...}}`
 *    (a receiver learns what the device polls), every later push
 *    `{"autopid_data": {...}}`; `full_first=false` sends the short form
 *    always;
 *  - ABRP: `token=<user token>&tlm=<url-encoded JSON>` form POST with
 *    the API key as a query parameter or `Authorization: APIKEY` header,
 *    the snapshot mapped to ABRP's telemetry keys (SOC->soc, HV_W->power,
 *    the dongle GPS fix -> lat/lon/elevation, ...).
 *
 * Settings: `data_destinations` (reboot-to-apply). Status + a one-shot
 * test: `GET /api/destinations`, `POST /api/destinations/test`.
