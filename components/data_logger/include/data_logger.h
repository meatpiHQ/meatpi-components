/**
 * @file data_logger.h
 * @brief WiCAN record logger (feature component) — the generic
 *        successor of legacy `obd_logger`.
 *
 * Model (ownership inversion, Architecture §5): producers REGISTER a
 * named parameter once (source + name, e.g. "autopid"/"rpm") and push
 * timestamped numeric records with data_logger_write(); this component
 * owns everything storage: the sqlite files on the SD card
 * (`/sd/logs/dl_<epoch>.db`), write batching, size rotation and
 * retention. Producers never block on the card — records go into a
 * bounded PSRAM ring (drop-oldest + counter, the log_manager
 * backpressure rule) drained by one writer task, the only code that
 * touches sqlite (the port is compiled THREADSAFE=0).
 *
 * Three storage engines, chosen by the `format` setting (meatpi
 * 2026-07-07: sqlite REQUIRED for tooling compatibility, append logs
 * added for speed — BENCHMARKS.md, bench card):
 *   "sqlite" (default) dl_<epoch>.db  — ~700 rows/s tuned;
 *     params(id, source, name UNIQUE) +
 *     records(ts [epoch ms], param_id, value REAL) + index on ts
 *   "csv"              dl_<epoch>.csv — `ts_ms,source.name,value`
 *   "binary"           dl_<epoch>.wdl — packed frames w/ inline param
 *     dictionary (data_logger_append.c documents the framing); the
 *     fast option (raw append benched ~170× tuned sqlite) for
 *     CAN-frame-rate streams
 *
 * Files rotate at max_file_mb; retention deletes the oldest beyond
 * max_files (across engines, so switching format still ages out old
 * files). Browse/download/delete goes through the existing /api/fs
 * file manager routes; /api/logger only reports status.
 *
 * Rule-driven gating (event_manager): the `logger.enable` /
 * `logger.disable` actions pause/resume the writer at runtime ("log
 * only while driving"). While paused the ring keeps absorbing, so an
 * enable rule flushes the newest pre-trigger records too.
