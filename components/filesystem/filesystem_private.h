 *
 * A unit that ran the factory firmware keeps that firmware's 6 MB LittleFS
 * where this firmware has its partitions, and a flash without an erase
 * leaves it there. LittleFS mounts a superblock whatever block count it
 * claims (the ESP port takes the count from the superblock), so a
 * filesystem from another layout "mounts" and every access past the
 * partition's end fails: error lines at boot, a latched fault, writes that
 * fail. Read the pair before mounting: the superblock entry sits at the
 * start of the pair's blocks as the 8-byte name "littlefs", a 4-byte tag
 * and the inline struct {version, block_size, block_count, ...} as
 * little-endian u32s (tags are XOR-chained, the data is not).
 *
 * @p blk0 / @p blk1: the first @p len bytes of blocks 0 and 1 (256 is
 * plenty: the entry is the first thing in a block). @p block_size: the
 * size this firmware mounts with. BLANK = both erased (never formatted);
 * LITTLEFS = a superblock of a version-2 filesystem with that block size,
 * its block count in @p block_count; OTHER = neither (another filesystem,
 * or data blocks of one). Pure: host-tested. A copy lives in
 * settings_manager (settings_manager_lfs.c), which sits below this
 * component. */
