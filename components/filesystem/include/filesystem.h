/**
 * @file filesystem.h
 * @brief WiCAN general-purpose file API (core component).
 *
 * Owns the internal-flash data filesystem (LittleFS on the `storage`
 * partition) and presents one path-based interface. Callers use logical
 * paths; the component routes them to the right backend:
 *
 *   /data/...   internal flash (LittleFS) — firmware-managed data
 *   /sd/...     SD card via external_storage — bulk/web/log data
 *
 * Pinned behaviors (ARCHITECTURE.md §5, REVIEW.md §6.1):
 *   - Path namespace: a path is addressed by its logical prefix above. There
 *     is no transparent fallback — a caller that wants SD data asks for /sd.
 *   - SD absent / backend unavailable: operations return
 *     ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE. (v1 ships the internal backend only; /sd is
 *     reserved and unavailable until external_storage exists.)
 *   - filesystem_write() is ALWAYS atomic (temp file + fsync + rename) and
 *     auto-creates parent directories. Callers never reimplement safe writes.
 *   - filesystem_list() exists so UIs can enumerate candidates for the
 *     settings schema `format:"file"` keyword.
 *
 * Concurrency: all operations are internally serialized with one mutex.
 * Handles from filesystem_open() are plain stdio streams owned by the
 * caller and are NOT covered by that serialization.
 *
 * Memory (Coding Standard §2, ARCHITECTURE §12): read/write data is bounced
 * through an internal-RAM scratch buffer (cache-off during flash ops), so
 * caller buffers may live in PSRAM. Do not call ANY operation here —
 * reads included — from a task whose stack is in PSRAM: littlefs reads go
 * through esp_partition_read, which also disables the flash cache
 * (asserts in spi_flash_disable_interrupts_caches_and_other_cpu;
 * bench-proven 2026-07-07 via the event dispatcher). Marshal to an
 * internal-stack context instead (async writer for writes; a one-shot
 * loader task like script_engine's for reads).
