# ha_webhooks

## Summary

The Home Assistant integration (v6 port of the legacy `ha_webhooks` +
autopid webhook poster). Owns the HA telemetry link in both directions:

- **inbound** `/api/webhook`: the HA HACS integration auto-registers its
  webhook URL (discovery push), applied live;
- **outbound** a poster task that, every `interval_s` while enabled +
  network up, POSTs `{status, autopid_data, config, gps}` to the URL(s)
  with failover. autopid may be OFF: `autopid_data` is then simply omitted
  (a status-only push is a valid contract push).

Feature component. Consumes `http_server_manager` (the route),
`http_client_manager` (outbound POST + TLS), `cert_manager` (private-CA
sets), `autopid` (`autopid_snapshot` + `autopid_config_json_dup`),
`dev_status_manager` (the status section + `device_id`),
`battery_monitor` (`batt_voltage`), `wifi_manager` (`sta_ip`),
`vpn_manager` (`vpn_status`/`vpn_ip`) and `mdns_manager` (the `mdns`
configuration URL). Config lives in
`settings_manager` (`"ha_webhooks"`); the URL push is a documented live
exception to reboot-to-apply.

**This is the cross-product MeatPi↔HA contract** (device-contract v2,
see `device-contract/` and the payload reference in `HTTP_API.md`):
identical on every product built from the V6 core.

## Design notes

- **PSRAM-safe poster (§2 corollary).** The poster runs on a PSRAM stack,
  so every payload source must be RAM: `autopid_snapshot` (RAM cache),
  `autopid_config_json_dup` (a NEW PSRAM cache of `config.json`, the
  poster must NOT read flash), `dev_status_manager` getters. Stats are a
  cache-only write (no flash) via a mutex-guarded status struct.
- **Payload contract.** Byte-verified against the live HACS integration
  (`coordinator.py handle_webhook_data`); contract-v2 shape 2026-07-11:
  `{schema:1, status, autopid_data, config}` with
  `status.device_id/fw_version/hw_version` GUARANTEED every push (diff
  mode overlays them back after the diff: HA's identity check + update
  entity read them). `status` also carries `device_type`, `mdns`,
  `wifi_mode`, `ble_status`, `batt_voltage`, (while the station holds an
  address) **`sta_ip`** (2026-10-11, issue #977: the integration's station
  IP diagnostic sensor and the device card's `configuration_url` read it;
  the legacy `/check_status` had it for the polling integration, no
  webhook push ever did), `vpn_status` (always: `disabled | waiting |
  paused | connecting | connected`, vpn_manager's own words since issue
  #985) and, while the tunnel is up, `vpn_ip` (HA's away-from-home
  backup endpoint).
  Sections are diffed in `changed` mode and omitted when empty; a fresh
  registration forces a full **resync** so a new HA sees the complete
  state (since 2026-10-11 that full push also primes the diff caches,
  so the next push is a real diff; it used to go out whole once more,
  the sta_ip bench caught it). The builders live in
  `ha_webhooks_payload.c` (`hw_payload_build()`), the poster task,
  gzip and the failover in `ha_webhooks_post.c`. **`gps`** (2026-09-09): the contract §5.4 block
  `{latitude, longitude, accuracy, altitude, speed, heading, satellites}`
  from `usb_acm_cli_gps_get()` while a live fix exists: what HA's
  Location device_tracker reads (it never updated for WiCAN Pro before);
  sent whole on change, omitted without a fix.
- **No autopid gate (2026-09-08).** The poster used to skip every lap
  while `autopid.enabled` was false. A fresh device ships autopid OFF,
  so HA's discovery push got `201 Created` and then not one telemetry
  push ever left the device (`GET /api/webhook` stayed
  `status:"disabled"`, success/fail 0/0) - every entity in HA stayed
  "unavailable" with no error anywhere. The HA contract
  (`DEVICE_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md` §4: "a push with only `status` is
  fine") and the integration's fixed sensors (battery voltage, WiFi
  mode, uptime, ECU online) need no vehicle data, so the poster now
  gates on enabled + network only; `autopid_data` is omitted until
  autopid produces values. Regression bench:
  `tools/testbench/ha/ha_webhook_gate_bench.py`.
- **Failover** across `url` + `url2` (PRO); first 2xx wins. An HTTP 403
  from HA (identity rejection) skips failover; 3 consecutive rejected
  cycles pause the poster (`status: "rejected"`) until the next
  registration, the contract's "stop; needs user attention" action.
- **gzip** (setting, default off; either data mode): the push body is
  compressed via the **ROM miniz** deflate (`tdefl_*` are mask-ROM
  symbols: zero flash cost) with hand-rolled gzip framing (10 B header
  + raw deflate + CRC32/ISIZE; CRC = `mz_crc32` → `esp_rom_crc32_le`).
  The ~166 KB compressor state is a lazy one-time PSRAM alloc reused
  across posts (poster is the single caller). Compression failure falls
  back to the plain body: delivery beats savings. Off by default:
  HA integrations older than 2026-07-10 can't inflate. STACK LESSON
  (bench, 2026-07-11): ROM tdefl keeps several KB of Huffman/blocking
  locals on the CALLER's stack, the poster's stack overflowed on the first
  gzip push (clean canary panic) and was enlarged. The sizes written down
  then ("24 KB", "now 32 KB") were in words; `StackType_t` is one byte on
  xtensa, so they were 6 KB and 8 KB. Measured 2026-11-14 on that 8 KB
  stack, headroom left: a plain push 3.3 KB, an https push 3.1 KB, a push
  whose reply's settings are stored 2.6 KB. The stack is 16 KB since
  (PSRAM, cheap). Bench-measured ratio ~2.3-2.4× on small (0.6-1.6 KB)
  payloads; bigger autopid sets compress better.
- **TLS**: built-in bundle by default; `cert_set` for a private-cert HA;
  raw-IP HTTPS auto-skips CN (the chain is still verified;
  http_client_manager says so once a boot, in place of esp-tls's warning
  on every push: its README, TLS). The integration registers such a URL
  for a Home Assistant whose own web server has SSL on and no Local
  network URL (2026-11-14).
- **Active on (2026-11-08, Ali).** `networks` names the station networks
  the pushes go out on (`""` = every network, else names separated by
  commas); the poster asks `wifi_manager_sta_on_network()` before every
  attempt and waits while the station is on another network or on no WiFi
  at all, nothing counted as a failure, one I line per transition (`not on
  a selected network: pushes wait` / `on a selected network again`).
  `GET /api/webhook` and the `webhook` command show the list and whether
  the station is on one of its networks now; the UI's card has the
  dropdown with check boxes beside the other settings and its stats line
  reads `Waiting for <names>` while the pushes wait. The registration push
  keeps the stored list.
- **Settings in the reply to a push (2026-11-14).** Home Assistant can
  only register its webhook settings (the addresses, the post interval) by
  calling the device, and a car that is asleep at that moment, or on LTE
  without a VPN, cannot be called, although it reaches Home Assistant with
  every push. So the settings may come back in the reply: a `200` with
  `{"webhook": {...}}`, the registration's body plus a short revision
  (`rev`). The device stores the revision with the settings and reports it
  in every push (`status.webhook_rev`); Home Assistant repeats its settings
  until the device reports the revision it wants. No acknowledgement, no
  queue, a lost reply is made good by a later push. The rules, the wire
  format and the verdict words: `HTTP_API.md`, "Settings in the reply to a
  push". What matters in the code:
  - **One reader for both ways in.** `hw_reg_parse()` reads the body of
    `POST /api/webhook` and the reply's `webhook` object
    (`ha_webhooks_reg.c`, pure, host tested). With a `rev` every field has
    to be right; without one the older, forgiving rules hold and the device
    is left with no revision.
  - **From whom.** `hw_reply_trusted()`: https to a host name (chain and
    name verified), or a private address not reached through the station
    address of a network marked untrusted. https to an address by IP is
    NOT "verified": the name is not compared there, so it falls under the
    address rule. The two ends of the connection come from the socket
    (`http_client_manager`), the station's side from
    `wifi_manager_addr_on_untrusted_sta()`.
  - **The revision cannot lie.** It is stored beside a fingerprint of the
    four settings it names (`rev_sum`, FNV-1a over `enabled`, `url`, `url2`,
    `interval_s`); `hw_rev_reported()` gives `""` as soon as they differ.
    So a change through the web interface, a restored backup or a factory
    reset needs no hook: Home Assistant sees `""` and sends its settings
    again. Both keys live in the settings document, so settings and
    revision are one atomic write.
  - **The poster writes settings.** It runs on a PSRAM stack; the Settings
    Manager's storage goes through `flash_jobs`, which is what makes
    `hw_config_apply_live()` legal there. The reply path does not force a
    full snapshot (the same Home Assistant, the diff goes on), and it leaves
    a reply alone when the settings changed while the push was under way.
  - **Pinned means deaf.** With `manual_override` the pushes carry no
    `webhook_rev` (Home Assistant then sends nothing) and a reply's settings
    are refused, as a registration is.
- **Not the generic path.** For routing individual PIDs to arbitrary
  endpoints, use `event_manager` rules (`autopid.param → http.post`). This
  component is the fixed, always-on HA telemetry channel: different shape,
  which is why it's a dedicated poster (isolated blocking I/O) rather than
  an event_manager action on the shared dispatcher.

## Testing

- `host_test/` (`.\test.ps1 host ha_webhooks`, 9 tests): the pure rules of
  `ha_webhooks_reg.c`. The revision's alphabet and length, the fingerprint
  (each of the four settings breaks it, the user's own settings do not),
  the registration object without a revision (the older rules and their
  400 texts) and with one (every field held), the trust rule's truth
  table, and the decision on a reply body: delivered, applied, same,
  pinned, untrusted, too long, not JSON, invalid.
- `tools/testbench/ha/push_reply_bench.py` (`.\test.ps1 pushreply`, prints
  `PUSH REPLY PASS`): settings in the reply to a push, on the device. A
  stand-in for Home Assistant on the Pi (plain http and https, a public
  address and an mDNS name for the run) answers the pushes the way each
  leg asks and notes the revision every push reports. Taken, the same
  again without a flash write, a 204, an empty 200, `{}`, not JSON, over
  2048 bytes, a bad field, a 503; the settings and their revision across a
  restart; a registration with a revision, with a bad field, without one;
  pinned; the interval changed through the settings route; and from whom:
  plain http to a private and to a public address, https by IP to both,
  https by name. `-Untrusted` adds the station's network marked untrusted
  (the DUT's USB-C on the PC). The record: `testing/pushreply.md` in the
  firmware repo.
- `tools/testbench/ha_webhook_bench.py` (live-suite stage `ha_webhook`): a
  mock HA receiver on the Pi → register via `POST /api/webhook` → assert
  `{status+device_id, autopid_data?, config}` telemetry, failover to
  `url2`, GET stats, DELETE.
- `tools/testbench/ha/ha_webhook_gate_bench.py` (`HA WEBHOOK GATE
  PASS`): the fresh-device regression - autopid DISABLED (settings
  PUT + submit), register a receiver, expect status-only pushes
  (`status.device_id` present, no `autopid_data`) and `status:"ok"`
  stats; restores autopid and clears the webhook. Receiver on any
  host both sides reach (`--serve` on the PC, or `--pi rpi001`).
- `tools/testbench/ha/ha_webhook_sta_ip_bench.py` (`HA WEBHOOK STA IP
  PASS`, issue #977): the station address in the push. Registers a
  receiver; the first push (the resync) must carry `status.sta_ip` equal
  to the address of `/api/wifi/status`, a later push in `changed` mode
  must not repeat it unchanged (in `full` mode it is there every time),
  no ha_webhooks E line in the log ring; puts the registration it found
  back (or DELETEs when there was none) and the interval through
  settings. Same receiver options as the gate bench.
- `tools/testbench/ha/ha_lte_push_bench.py` (`HA LTE PUSH PASS`, runs ON
  rpi001): the car-on-the-road leg - the DUT roams to the paired
  ESPNetLink AP (LTE + GPS), `--capture` asserts the `gps` block + the
  `gps_*` sensors in the pushes; the HA mode registers the PRO dual URLs
  and proves the HTTPS failover carries the pushes over LTE; `--dut-vpn`
  is the REAL test against a bench HA reached through the WiCAN's own
  WireGuard tunnel (`tools/testbench/vpn/wg_ha_route.sh`). 2026-09-09:
  capture PASS; VPN mode PASS - HA registered its tunnel URL, the DUT
  roamed to LTE and kept pushing through the tunnel, HA's Location
  tracker took the `gps` block (`Updated GPS location ... accuracy 3m`).
  The HTTPS leg reached an HA over LTE but the dev HA's Nabu Casa remote
  domain belongs to another instance (TESTING.md).
  Real HA end-to-end available on `rpi002` (`~/workspace/ha-wican`).

## Open items

- **URL ordering on the road (2026-09-09).** `post_failover` always
  tries `url` (HA's local http URL) first; over LTE that address is
  unroutable, so EVERY cycle spends ~6 s in a connect timeout and logs
  the IDF connect-failure E triplet (`esp-tls select() timeout` /
  `Failed to open a new connection` / `Connection failed, sock < 0`)
  before `url2` delivers. A car parked on LTE does this forever. Worth
  a small policy: after N consecutive connect failures on `url`, try
  `url2` first and re-probe `url` every few minutes (never drop it -
  driving home must switch back).

## Memory footprint

- **Task stack**: one, the poster (`ha_webhook`), 16 KB static in PSRAM
  (8 KB until 2026-11-14). Measured headroom on the 8 KB stack: 3.3 KB
  after plain pushes, 3.1 KB after https pushes, 2.6 KB after a push whose
  reply's settings were stored (the deepest path).
- **Static, PSRAM**: the live config and the stats (about 1 KB together).
- **Heap, PSRAM**: the diff caches (the previous status, autopid, config
  and gps sections as text), the ROM deflate's state when gzip is on
  (about 166 KB, once), a push's body and its reply (at most 2 KB) while
  it is under way.
- **Internal RAM**: the task's TCB and the mutex.
- **Flash**: a registration or a reply that changes the settings writes
  the `ha_webhooks` settings document once; the same settings again are
  not written (the Settings Manager's dedup; the bench asserts it).
