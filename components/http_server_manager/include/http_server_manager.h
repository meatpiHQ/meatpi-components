/**
 * @file http_server_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN HTTP Server Manager — public API.
 *
 * Owns exactly one HTTP server (httpd_handle_t): port, socket config, lifecycle.
 * It is content-agnostic. Two kinds of things register into it:
 *
 *  - API routes:   components register httpd_uri_t handlers for their endpoints.
 *  - Asset tables: components (e.g. web_ui) register http_asset_t tables; the
 *                  manager serves them via a single wildcard catch-all that is
 *                  installed last, so specific API routes always win.
 *
 * Fetch-on-miss: an asset with a filesystem path and a source_url is downloaded
 * once (via the fetcher injected by main, see set_asset_fetcher) when the file is
 * missing, then served locally on every subsequent request.
 *
 * See components/http_server_manager/README.md and ARCHITECTURE.md §8.
 *
 * Lifecycle (called by main, in dependency order):
 *   http_server_manager_init();      // configure, nothing listening yet
 *   <comp>_init();                   // components register routes / assets
 *   http_server_manager_start();     // install handlers, catch-all last, listen
