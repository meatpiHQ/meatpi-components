/**
 * @file imu_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN motion sensor owner (feature component).
 *
 * Owns the ICM-42670-P IMU (shared bus via i2c_bus; vendored espressif
 * driver) and runs BOTH of its motion detectors side by side. The
 * detector task POLLS INT_STATUS2 every 200 ms — the bits latch until
 * read, so nothing is missed and there is no ISR (meatpi's call: safer,
 * and nothing here is time-critical; the chip's INT1 pin stays wired
 * but unused):
 *
 *  - SMD (DMP/APEX, needs SUSTAINED motion) drives the ACTIVITY state —
 *    "the vehicle is moving": ACTIVE (+ DEV_STATUS_BIT_MOTION) until
 *    quiet for `stationary_s` → STATIONARY. Sleep/drive logic consumes
 *    the dev-status bit.
 *  - WoM (per-sample threshold, PREVIOUS-sample reference so a slope or
 *    orientation change can't latch it) catches single bumps — door
 *    open/close, a knock, vibration. It does NOT touch the activity
 *    state; it is published as an EVENT.
 *
 * EVENTS: any component subscribes a queue (`imu_manager_event_t` items)
 * and reacts — send a CAN frame on a door slam, an MQTT alert on motion,
 * whatever the product wants. Fan-out is drop-and-count per subscriber
 * (never blocks the detector task); WOM publishes are throttled so
 * driving vibration can't flood the queues. Activity transitions are
 * published too, so most consumers never need to poll.
 *
 * The accel runs permanently in low-power mode feeding both detectors
 * (reads work anytime); the gyro stays OFF in v1 — nothing consumes it,
 * and it dominates the chip's power budget.
