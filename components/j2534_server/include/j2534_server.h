/**
 * @file j2534_server.h
 * @brief SAE J2534 PassThru device — session + channel server. See
 *        TASK_j2534_server.md. Groundwork phase: the transport-agnostic
 *        frame pump + a TCP listener doing the session/channel HANDSHAKE
 *        (HELLO/OPEN/CONNECT/DISCONNECT/CLOSE). Vehicle I/O (CAN +
 *        ISO15765), filters, periodics, ioctl, and the USB-CDC transport
 *        are later phases; data ops answer ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED for now.
 *
 * Settings ("j2534_server", reboot-to-apply): enabled (default false),
 * port (TCP, default 6809), cli.
