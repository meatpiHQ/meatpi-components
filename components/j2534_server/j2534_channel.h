/**
 * @file j2534_channel.h
 * @brief J2534 channel transport bindings — a CAN channel onto
 *        can_manager (raw frames), an ISO15765 channel onto the
 *        registered ISO-TP provider (can_isotp.h; without one,
 *        ISO15765 connect fails with a log line). Owned by
 *        j2534_server; the server pumps RX and pushes RX_MSG frames.
 *
 * Message data conventions (this wire protocol, TASK §4):
 *   CAN       msg.data = [4-byte big-endian CAN id][0..8 frame bytes]
 *   ISO15765  msg.data = the UDS payload (the CAN id is the channel's
 *             tx/rx id set at CONNECT or by a FLOW_CONTROL filter)
