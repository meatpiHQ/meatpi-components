/**
 * @file log_manager_private.h
 * @brief Pure ring-buffer core (log_manager_ring.c) — no IDF deps, compiled
 *        directly by the host unit tests. The header/data live in PSRAM
 *        `.noinit` on target; validity is guarded by magic/version/CRC so
 *        power-on garbage is detected (same pattern as restart_tracker).
