# obd_chip

## Summary

Feature component: the **single owner** of the external OBD chip (MIC3624,
ELM327 v2.3 dialect with `VT*` vendor commands) on UART1 (GPIO16 TX/GPIO15 RX,
2 Mbaud), plus its sleep pin (GPIO9), READY pin (GPIO7) and reset pin (GPIO41).
Nobody else touches that UART or those pins. Implements the task spec
(`../obd_chip_manager/TASK_obd_chip_manager.md`): one RX task fanning chip
output to subscriber queues, serialized TX, a claim model for the modal
protocol, a host-tested request→response engine, and the verified legacy
firmware-update flow.

## The broadcast contract (normative)

The manager does **no routing, filtering or parsing on the hot path**: every
subscriber receives ALL chip output (other components' responses, monitor
frames, unsolicited lines) and keeps or ignores what it wants. A full
subscriber queue drops that subscriber's chunk (counted, rate-limited WARN at
1/100) and never stalls the RX task or other subscribers. The command engine
itself is just another subscriber - one that subscribes for exactly the
duration of each `request()` (2026-09-08: a standing subscription filled
its 64-slot queue with every app line while idle, so an ELM app streaming
through a bridge for minutes drew a drop WARN every 100 chunks for
nothing). Do not add per-subscriber filters here.

**RX latency (2026-09-08):** the RX task blocks on the UART driver's
event queue and drains by buffered length, so a response is fanned out
as soon as the chip finished printing it (the FIFO rx-timeout, 10
symbol times = 50 us at 2 Mbaud). It used to poll `uart_read_bytes(128,
20 ms)`, which keeps waiting for "more" after the LAST byte until the
budget expires - every short response paid ~20 ms on top of the chip's
~3 ms (bench: a hinted `010C 1` over TCP cost 23-26 ms end to end; the
legacy firmware, event-driven, was in the single digits). Overflow
events (`UART_FIFO_OVF`/`UART_BUFFER_FULL`) flush the ring and log a
WARN; the idle wake (100 ms) drains too, so a lost event can never
strand bytes. Do not reintroduce a timed read on this task.

## Measured chip behaviour, large payloads and floods (2026-09-08)

Bench: `tools/testbench/obd/vt_large_bench.py` (PCAN memory ECU on
7E4/7EC with the simulator's ECU switched off; `pcan_memory_ecu.py`)
and `atma_flood_bench.py` (PCAN counter frames, `/api/can` as the on-bus
witness), both through the product path TCP:35000 → bridge → UART → chip.

- **Transmit, 4 KB**: `VTFullyRequestCk0FFF36<bsc><4064 B><CCCC>` (the
  MTPS-OBD tester's shape, `wican_pro_tester/MTPS-OBD+Log.TXT`), the
  8 159-char line crosses socket → bridge → UART intact (bytes conserved)
  and the chip transmits the ISO-TP transfer in ~220 ms; the ECU verified
  every byte at 64/512/2048/4064 B. Its `7F 36 78` (pending) then `76 xx`
  come back as the tester sees them.
- **Receive, 4 KB**: a `23` read of 4094 B is delivered complete,
  headers ON: 586 raw frame lines (`7EC 10 FF 63 00 01 …`, `7EC 21 …`),
  11.7 KB of text, ~150 ms of frames + the `ATST` wait; headers OFF: a
  length line (`FFF`) then `0: 63 00 …` rows (7 B per row, one-hex-digit
  index that wraps), 14.6 KB with spaces. Byte-exact at the client, zero
  drops at every hop, `rx_max_chunk` 128.
- **The `1` "expected responses" hint ends a multi-frame response after
  its FIRST FRAME when headers are on** (64 B → one FF line, 2 KB → `NO
  DATA`). Hinted requests are for single-frame answers (the RPM case);
  never hint a long read. With headers off the hint counts messages.
- **Multi-frame assembly and automatic flow control exist only for the
  OBD physical range** (`ATSH 7E0–7E7`, responses 7E8–7EF). On 740/748
  the chip printed the First Frame raw and sent no FC: `ATFCSH`/`ATFCSD
  300000`/`ATFCSM1` did not change that on this chip. `ATAL` is accepted
  and harmless (the tester sends it).
- **ATMA flood**: 4000 frames/s (12 000 counter frames) printed at
  56 KB/s with every frame seen once, in order; no UART overflow, no
  fan-out drops, bytes conserved to the client. The limit that was found
  sat on the ESP side (one socket send per frame line) and is fixed by
  the raw-bridge coalescing in bridge_manager.

## Chunk format & memory choice

`obd_chunk_t { uint16 len; uint8 data[128] }` **by value** on the queues:
no pooling, no ref-counting, no lifetime bugs. Cost: 130 B per queue slot ×
depth, paid by each subscriber in PSRAM; fan-out is one memcpy per subscriber
per chunk. At 2 Mbaud worst case ≈ 1.6 k chunks/s, measured fine; revisit
zero-copy only with numbers.

## API (see include/obd_chip.h)

| Function | One-liner |
|---|---|
| `obd_chip_init/start/stop` | Lifecycle: driver+pins / **launch** the wake-reset-negotiate-ATE0-RX bring-up (async, see below) / stop task. `start` refuses unconfigured (§4.3). |
| `obd_chip_ready()` | True once bring-up finished with the chip answering (false in flight AND after give-up). |
| `obd_chip_subscribe/unsubscribe(q, name)` | RX fan-out registration (caller owns the queue, item = `obd_chunk_t`). |
| `obd_chip_dropped(q)` | Per-subscriber drop counter. |
| `obd_chip_send(data,len)` | Serialized raw TX (a 4 KB VT payload is one call); rejected during EXCLUSIVE. |
| `obd_chip_get_stats()` / `obd_chip_get_subscribers()` / `obd_chip_register_http()` | Observability (2026-09-08): wire + fan-out counters (`rx_bytes/chunks/max_chunk`, `rx_overflows`, `rx_buffered`, `tx_bytes`, claim, client idle) and per-subscriber `dropped/queued/depth`, served as `GET /api/obd_chip` (`obd_chip_http.c`, hand-formatted JSON). The first hop of any "missed frames" investigation: compare with `/api/bridges` and `/api/sockets`. |
| `obd_chip_client_touch()` / `obd_chip_client_idle_ms()` | The external-client activity clock (2026-09-08): the bridge glue's `obd` endpoint touches it on every app write (TCP/BLE/USB/WS), autopid reads the idle time and yields the chip while an app drives it (legacy `DEV_AUTOPID_ELM327_APP_BIT` parity, 10 s). NOT touched by `obd_chip_send` itself - autopid's own monitor sends go through that and would pause autopid against itself. `UINT32_MAX` = no client ever wrote. |
| `obd_chip_request(cmd,resp,len,timeout)` | One transaction: claims COMMAND, collects to the `>` prompt, strips echo+prompt. Refuses monitor-class cmds (`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`). |
| `obd_chip_protocol_save(proto)` | (2026-10-01) ONE real `ATSP<proto>` per boot on the request path, bypassing the EEPROM guard: the chip learns its base protocol once after a vehicle detection. Caller: autopid's detection job only. `'1'..'9'`/`'A'..'C'` else `ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`; a second call this boot `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`; no `OK` = `ESP_FAIL`. Counted in `protocol_saves`. See "Protocol save" below. |
| `obd_chip_claim/release(type,timeout)` | COMMAND / MONITOR / EXCLUSIVE arbitration. |
| `obd_chip_is_monitor_cmd(cmd)` | Table-driven monitor-class test (pure). |
| `obd_chip_monitor_stop()` | The stop byte: **SPACE, never CR** (CR = repeat-last-command → can re-enter ATMA). |
| `obd_chip_sleep(on)` / `obd_chip_status_ok()` | Sleep pin (hold survives resets; wake = release sequence) / READY pin. |
| `obd_chip_park()` | (2026-10-05) Leave the chip asleep from a boot that never initialised this component (the firmware's crash park). Pins only. The chip meets a boot in one of two states: **awake** (a power-on, or the run before had it up), then it is hardware-reset first (a session or a monitor left open is closed, and a chip mid-monitor ignores the sleep pin) and put to sleep with the hold, about 0.6 s; or **asleep** (the boot follows a sleep and the sleep pin's hold is still on: READY reads high), then it is left asleep and its sleep pin is never driven high. Either way the next normal boot finds it asleep and wakes it as after any sleep. |
| `obd_chip_get_version(...)` | `VTVERS` → e.g. `MIC3624 V2.3.22`. |
| `obd_chip_firmware_update(fs_path, force)` | EXCLUSIVE; the verified legacy flow (below). |

## Async bring-up (2026-07-26: Ali's boot-time ruling)

`obd_chip_start()` no longer blocks boot: the wake → conditional reset →
baud negotiation → `ATE0` → legacy provisioning → RX-task sequence
(~2 s typical, the biggest single step of the 4.1 s boot) runs on a
one-shot `obd_bringup` task (4 KB internal (same rule as the RX task)
prio 5, self-deleting, exit `stack_hw` logged per the stack-audit
convention). Consequences:

- **Wire-touching APIs gate on completion** so nothing interleaves with
  the bare-UART probes: `send()`/`monitor_stop()`/`firmware_update()`
  wait up to `OBD_BRINGUP_WAIT_MS` (20 s, past the worst hard-reset +
  baud-walk + provisioning case) then refuse `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`;
  `request()` waits within the CALLER's own timeout and returns
  `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT` without touching the wire (boot-window callers like
  the autopid poller simply retry). After the DONE flip the gate is a
  zero-cost flag test. `subscribe()`/`claim()` are pure state: ungated.
- `obd_chip_sleep(true)`/`obd_chip_hard_reset()` wait too (a sleep-entry
  race mid-bring-up would strand the sequence) but then proceed
  regardless: sleeping is the stronger intent.
- A **degraded start** (never called / refused unconfigured) leaves the
  gate OPEN: behavior is exactly the legacy pass-through (writes go out,
  requests time out naturally).
- The boot line's `obd=1` now means "bring-up launched"; the real outcome
  is the component's own `started: chip …` / `bring-up failed:` log line
  plus `obd_chip_ready()`. A bring-up failure logs `E` AFTER the boot
  health report has printed: it shows in the runtime error counters,
  not the boot-errors budget.
- If the task can't spawn, start falls back to the legacy synchronous
  path inline.

**Measured on the DUT 2026-07-26**: boot line 4.25 s → 2.27 s; bring-up
1992 ms on its task (`stack_hw` 1696 B of 4096); chip answers
`ELM327 v2.3` ready=1; boot HEALTH errors=0, faults=0; first post-reboot
TCP-35000 `ATI` returns clean `ELM327 v2.3` (no boot-window garbage).

### The reset is verified (2026-10-03)

The sequence lives in `obd_chip_bringup.c` (split out of `obd_chip.c`, which
keeps the task and the gate). An awake chip is reset by command, and until
this date one `ATZ` with a prompt after it counted as done. On a software
restart of the ESP the chip usually answered that first command with a
prompt and NO reset (what the last run left in its line buffer, or a glitch
of our TX pin, sat in front of it): saved console logs show bring-up in
852 ms on 15 of 30 boots and 2096 ms on the other 15, power-on boots always
2096 ms. The chip then kept everything the previous run had set: echo,
headers, filters and an established CAN session.

That last one is not cosmetic. A chip holding a session at 500 kbit/s is a
node at 500 kbit/s; on a bus at another bitrate it answers every frame with
an error flag (bench: about 450 error frames a second on a 250k bus, the
sender driven to bus-off, with the firmware's own CAN node off and autopid
disabled). `ATPC` or a real reset stops it; a freshly reset chip is quiet
until its next request, whatever its default protocol is.

`chip_soft_reset()`: one throw-away `ATI` (whatever sits in front ends with
it), then `ATZ`, and the answer must carry the banner (`ELM`). Twice, then
the reset pin as before. Bring-up is 2147 ms on every boot now (it runs on
its own task, so the boot line does not move). Check after a restart:
`ATDPN` through the ELM port reads the default protocol, and the
`bring-up done in` log line reads about 2.1 s.

Related chip fact: with its memory function at the power-on default the chip
stores the last protocol that answered in its own EEPROM (`ATDPN` reads
`A6` when a search found it, `6` when a pinned `ATTP6` did). It writes only
when the value changes, and the firmware pins one protocol per car, so this
is one write per change of car; the EEPROM guard (ATSP / ATM1) does not
cover it.

## Bridge-endpoint ABI (TASK_obd_chip_manager_new §2/§3.6: stable)

The `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`/`send` trio is this component's face to
`bridge_manager`: glue or `main` wraps it into a `bridge_endpoint_t` (three
one-line functions), obd_chip itself never depends on bridge_manager.
`obd_chunk_t` is layout-identical to `bridge_chunk_t`/`socket_chunk_t` by
convention, so bridge queues carry it unmodified. **Treat the trio's shape
as a stable ABI**: every configured bridge (TCP, BLE, the USB port-B
passthrough, which is a `raw` bridge in bridge_manager, NOT code here)
depends on it. The test app's USB bridge is exactly this shape and predates
bridge_manager; production replaces it with a configured bridge.

## Claim model (task §5)

- `request()` claims COMMAND internally; concurrent requesters serialize
  (10 ms retry loop, caller timeout).
- MONITOR held ⇒ `request()`/COMMAND claims **fail fast**
  `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` (**policy "manual"**: the settings key
  `monitor_policy` reserves `auto_interrupt`, pending meatpi's answer to task
  §11.6; nothing auto-sends the stop byte in v1).
- EXCLUSIVE (fw update): fan-out pauses (RX task discards), `send()` rejects.
- Raw bridges are ungoverned by nature: a user typing `ATMA` through a bridge
  without claiming makes `request()` callers see garbage-until-timeout, not
  corruption, the engine treats an unterminated window as `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`
  ("bus busy"). Bridges SHOULD claim MONITOR on their client's behalf.
- **Cross-requester (obd_gate, 2026-07-11)**: the claim model arbitrates
  the CHIP's users; the chip as a whole additionally holds the shared
  `obd_gate` while a command is in flight (`send()` acquires on a CR,
  the RX fan-out releases on the line-start `'>'`) so its conversations
  never overlap the ESP-side ELM engines on the same physical CAN bus.
  See `components/obd_gate/README.md`.

## Firmware update (verified legacy flow: do not improvise)

`VTVERS` (expect `MIC3624 …`) → `VTDLMIC3422` → `VTDLDT<line>` per record
(each answered `OK`; `?` = rejected) → stop at the `FFF1…` end marker →
`VTDLED` (2 s settle, 3 attempts) → hardware reset pulse (GPIO41 low 5 ms) →
rewake. Vendor images are `.txt` hex-record files (~3.5 k lines / ~490 KB).
Two sources: a `filesystem` path (`obd_chip_firmware_update`, read whole
into PSRAM) or the **packaged image** (`obd_chip_firmware_update_builtin`,
`EMBED_TXTFILES` of `obd_chip_manager/obd_fw/V2.3.22.txt`, byte-identical
to legacy `main/obd_fw`; +483 KB app size). Update responses DO end with
the `>` prompt (bench-verified): byte-level echo-skip, collect until `>`,
then classify `OK`/`?` (`obd_chip_fw.c`). Returning early on `OK\r` without
waiting for the prompt makes the next record race the chip and get dropped.

**Auto-update (legacy parity, Ali ruled 2026-07-26):** with the
`auto_update` setting on (default), the bring-up task runs the builtin
update with `force=false` after every bring-up, a chip already at the
packaged version costs one `VTVERS` and skips; a different version is
flashed (~30 s, EXCLUSIVE: consumers see timeouts meanwhile, log lines
mark start/progress/done); a chip stuck in download mode (`?`, which
also fails bring-up) is recovered by completing the download. Stricter
than legacy in ONE case: a `VTVERS` **timeout** (dead wire) aborts
instead of streaming records into 5 s timeouts. Bumping the packaged
version = new `EMBED_TXTFILES` path + `OBD_FW_BUILTIN_VERSION` in
`obd_chip_fw.c`.

## Settings (`"obd_chip"`, version 3)

The UART baud is **not a setting**: `OBD_CHIP_BAUD` (2 Mbaud) in
`obd_chip_private.h`. meatpi 2026-09-07: exposing it invited a user changing
it, breaking the chip and claiming warranty; v3 drops a stored `baud` on
migration. The same decision took **every** `obd_chip` field out of the web
UI (they only confused users): the group stays reachable through the
settings API / CLI / backup for the future sleep_manager work.


| Key | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto_sleep` | bool | `false` | reserved (the future sleep_manager arms the chip's controls) |
| `auto_update` | bool | `true` | flash the packaged chip fw (V2.3.22) on version mismatch after bring-up: legacy parity |
| `monitor_policy` | enum manual/auto_interrupt | `manual` | `auto_interrupt` reserved (§5 open question) |
| `wake_voltage_mv` | int 12000–15000 (must exceed `sleep_voltage_mv`) | `13500` | chip VL wake threshold, provisioned at boot (`STSLVLW`) |
| `sleep_voltage_mv` | int 12000–14000 | `13200` | chip VL sleep threshold, provisioned at boot (`STSLVLS`) |
| `sleep_time_min` | int 1–60 | `2` | chip VL sleep hold; programmed as `min*60+30` s (the ESP sleeps first: legacy guard) |

## Boot provisioning (task §11.5: ANSWERED by meatpi 2026-07-04: "follow legacy init")

`start()` after `ATE0`: read `STSLCS` (pure parser `obd_chip_stslcs.c`,
grammar = the legacy `main/obd.c` sscanf patterns, fixture = a real
MIC3624 capture) and, ONLY when something differs, rewrite the chip's
stored sleep config: ensure NATIVE control mode (`ATPP 0E SV 7A`+`ON`),
program the VL thresholds/time from settings with every autonomous
control left **OFF** (`STSLVLW`/`STSLVLS`/`STSLVl off,off`/
`STSLU off, off`: byte-exact legacy strings), persist the 2 M power-on
baud (`ATPP 0F SV 95`+`ON`, only when `baud=2000000`), `STSLUIT 1200`,
then `ATZ` + re-bring-up (baud restore + `ATE0`). A matching chip skips
everything: verified live: provisioning ran once after flashing, the
next boots go straight to `started`.

**Framing lesson (found live by STSLCS):** the `>` prompt terminates a
response only at LINE START, `STSLCS` data contains mid-line `>`
(`VL_WAKE: OFF, >13.50V`), which used to truncate the accumulator and
trigger a reprovision-every-boot loop (`obd_parse_feed`, host-tested).

## Open stubs (task §11: ask meatpi)

1. ~~**READY pin semantics**~~ **ANSWERED 2026-07-04** (legacy
   `elm327_chip_get_status`, reference copy in
   `../obd_chip_manager/elm327.c`): the pin is **ACTIVE LOW**,
   LOW = awake/ready (`ELM327_READY = 0`), HIGH = asleep. The earlier
   "reads 0 while answering" observation was correct behavior; the v6
   polarity was inverted and is fixed (`obd_pin_ready`,
   `obd_chip_status_ok`).
2. ~~Full **chip init sequence**~~ **ANSWERED 2026-07-04** (meatpi:
   "follow legacy init"), see *Boot provisioning* above. Boot now also
   follows the legacy `elm327_init` flow: RESET pin is an OPEN-DRAIN
   output; reset is CONDITIONAL (READY says awake → soft `ATZ`,
   asleep/stuck → hardware pulse); `STWBR` persists a successful `STSBR`
   switch as the chip's power-on baud; fw ≥ V2.3.22 gets the power-pin
   check (`VTPPSWS` → `VTPPSW10` + reset when wrong); a READY-wait loop
   (10 × 200 ms, then one forced reset) gates the bring-up; sleep parks
   BOTH the SLEEP and READY pins (pulldown + RTC pulldown + hold).
   UART ring buffers: legacy 18 K / 18 K, and they live in **PSRAM** in
   both firmwares, the driver allocates them with `MALLOC_CAP_DEFAULT`
   (`UART_ISR_IN_IRAM` off) and the SPIRAM malloc policy routes that to
   PSRAM. No DMA is involved (the ISR copies the 128 B hardware FIFO
   into the ring), so PSRAM placement is safe exactly as it was in
   legacy.
3. ~~`VT` 4 KB ISO-TP command syntax~~ **ANSWERED + bench-verified
   2026-07-03** (meatpi's vector, 4095 bytes reassembled byte-exact on PCAN;
   cross-checked against the WiCAN Pro tester project:
   `wican_pro_tester/protocol_notes.md` + `MTPS-OBD+Log.TXT`):
   `VTFullyRequestCk<LLLL><data hex><CCCC>[ <n>]`, LLLL = byte count (4
   hex, max 0FFF), CCCC = 16-bit additive checksum of the payload bytes,
   optional space-separated `<n>` = the standard ELM "expected number of
   responses" hint (the tester logs use the same form on plain requests:
   `22F106 1`). The chip transmits on the current header (0x7DF default;
   the tester uses `ATSH7E0` on CAN channels and J1850 3-byte headers like
   `ATSHC4D0F5` on VPW), REQUIRES a prompt Flow Control from the response
   ID on CAN (0x7E8 for 0x7DF; ignores the ECU sim's FC from request−8 =
   0x7D7; answers `FC RX TIMEOUT` otherwise), then prints EACH ECU response
   message (headers shown per the header setting, including `7F xx 78`
   response-pending interims) or `NO DATA` if none, then the `>` prompt.

   **Real-world transcript (tester log, channel 2 = J1850 VPW `AT SP2`,
   UDS `0x36` TransferData: the production use case is ECU flashing):**

   ```
   >ATSHC4D0F5                              <- J1850 prio/target/source
   OK
   >VTFullyRequestCk03FF3600...<1023 B>...1CA8 2
   C4F5D07F3678C0        <- response w/ header: 7F 36 78 = pending
   C4F5D0760022          <- final positive response 76 ...
   ```

   (The `IT CH_NO <n>` + `OK` lines that follow in the raw log are NOT
   chip output: that is the MTPS-OBD **Bluetooth tester box** being told
   to switch channels for the next test step; see
   `wican_pro_tester/protocol_notes.md`. The VT response ends with the ECU
   messages + prompt, exactly as reproduced on our bench.)

   Repeatable check: `tools/testbench/obd_vt_isotp_check.py [--size N]`,
   the PC side is a real ISO-TP stack (python-can + can-isotp `CanStack`),
   so FC, sequence numbers and reassembly are standards-checked; byte-exact
   with zero stack errors at 7/100/4095 bytes. Goes through plain
   `obd_chip_request()`/`send()`: no component changes were needed.
4. Authoritative **monitor-class command list** (table currently
   ATMA/ATMR/ATMT/STM/STMA in `obd_chip_parse.c`).
5. `monitor_policy=auto_interrupt` behavior.

## Dependencies

`esp_driver_uart`, `esp_driver_gpio`, `settings_manager`, `log_manager`,
`filesystem` (fw file reads): all private. Init order: after the core
managers; `settings_manager_start()` before `obd_chip_start()`.

## Memory footprint (estimated: measure before release)

| Where | What | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Internal | UART driver RX 8 KB + TX 4 KB (`// internal: DMA`), RX-task stack 16 KB (`// internal: UART driver path`), TX mutex/TCB | ~29 KB |
| PSRAM `.bss` | subscriber registry, cmd-engine queue (64×130 B) + accumulator (16 KB since 2026-09-08: a 4 KB ISO-TP response is 8–12.5 KB of hex; the 4 KB accumulator truncated it) + bare_probe accumulator (16 KB), config | ~41 KB |
| PSRAM heap | fw image buffer during update only | ~500 KB transient |

## Tests

- **Host (`host_test/`, 16 tests):** pure framing, prompt splits at every
  chunk boundary, echo strip, post-prompt bytes not consumed, noise
  interleave, **meatpi's real 36-line proprietary-PID log replayed at chunk
  sizes 1…4096**, overflow flagging, error/monitor classification, fw-file
  iterator + FFF1 marker, the EEPROM guard (rewrites, pass-throughs,
  refusals, raw-chunk semantics, and since 2026-10-01 a mixed-protocol
  profile chain `ATSP6;...;ATSP7;...` whose BOTH protocol switches come out
  as `ATTP`), the STSLCS parser + provisioning policy.
- **On-target (`test_apps/`, live bench):** all green 2026-07-03, see
  `test_apps/README.md` for markers and the bench doc pointer.

## EEPROM guard (2026-09-16)

The chip persists a few settings to EEPROM and EEPROM has a write budget:
`ATSP`/`ATSPA` (protocol), `ATM1` (memory on: every later protocol change
sticks), `ATPP xx SV/ON/OFF` (programmable parameters; 0C/0F re-baud the UART
= a bricked link), `ATSD` (store data byte), `ATCV` (voltage calibration),
STN `STWBR`/`STSAVCAL`. Init strings replay per poll transition, apps re-send
`ATSP` on every connect, terminal users type anything, so the guard lives in
the driver, on every TX path (`obd_chip_guard.h`, pure, host-tested in
`obd_chip_parse.c`):

- rewritten in place, same length: `ATSP..` -> `ATTP..`, `ATM1` -> `ATM0`;
- refused: `ATPP` (except `ATPPS`, the summary read), `ATSD`, `ATCV`, `STWBR`,
  `STSAVCAL`. `obd_chip_request()` returns ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED; the raw
  bridge path (`obd_chip_send`) drops the chunk and fans `?` + prompt back so
  the app or terminal sees the ELM rejection and the chip never sees the write.

A token counts only at a command boundary (start, CR/LF/space/tab/';'), so
`DATA`, the `ST` inside `ATSTFF` and hex payloads never match. Counters:
`GET /api/obd_chip` -> `eeprom_guard.rewrites` / `.blocked` /
`.protocol_saves`; refused commands log at W with the text. autopid's
`ap_init_sanitize()` is a wrapper over this guard and its config parse refuses
a refused command in `cmd`/`init`; the UDS AT transport sends `ATTP` itself.
Exempt by construction: boot provisioning (`bare_probe`: STSL*, `ATPP 0E/0F`,
`STWBR`, once, behind a matching check) and the firmware update flow, which
write the UART directly.

### Protocol save (2026-10-01, TASK_quick_setup.md "Protocol policy")

With the guard alone the chip would power up on whatever its EEPROM held
from the factory or an old app, and search (`SEARCHING...`) at every boot.
`obd_chip_protocol_save(proto)` is the ONE deliberate exception: a real
`ATSP<proto>` (set AND save) through the same serialized transaction path
as `obd_chip_request()` (COMMAND claim, obd_gate, the `>` prompt), with the
guard switched off for that single command. Rules enforced in the driver,
whatever the caller does: `proto` is `1`..`9` or `A`..`C` (never `ATSP0`,
`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`), at most ONE save per boot (`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`
afterwards, so a misbehaving caller cannot wear the EEPROM), the chip must
answer `OK` (`ESP_FAIL` otherwise, `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT` on silence). The only
caller is autopid's vehicle detection job, after a successful detection,
when the car record's `chip_protocol` differs from the detected base
protocol; it then records `chip_protocol`. Everything else on the wire
stays `ATTP`: autopid's baseline re-asserts the base RAM-only after an
ELM app had the chip, and a mixed-protocol profile's per-PID `ATSP7` keeps
being rewritten to `ATTP7` by the guard (host test: the MEB-style chain).
Counted in `obd_chip_stats_t.protocol_saves` and `GET /api/obd_chip`
`eeprom_guard.protocol_saves` (0 or 1 per boot); logged at I on success.

## Transaction hold (2026-09-16)

`obd_chip_txn_begin(timeout)` / `obd_chip_txn_end()`: the calling task takes the
COMMAND claim across several `obd_chip_request()` calls (they nest; other
requesters wait at their claim timeout, autopid's poll included). Born from the
UDS AT transport: 7 setup commands + the request, and autopid's poll used to
land between them (bench: 1 of 3 UDS requests survived with polling, 5 of 5
with autopid paused). `end()` drops the hold whatever the nesting depth.
