/**
 * @file obd_chip.h
 * @brief WiCAN OBD chip manager (feature component): the single owner of the
 *        external OBD chip (ELM327-dialect MIC3624) on UART1.
 *
 * Ownership pattern (Architecture §2): nobody else touches the chip's UART,
 * sleep pin (GPIO9), status pin (GPIO7) or reset pin (GPIO41), ever.
 *
 * ## RX fan-out (broadcast contract)
 * One RX task reads ALL chip output and copies each chunk into every
 * subscriber's queue. The manager does NO routing, filtering or parsing on
 * the hot path: every subscriber receives everything (other components'
 * responses, monitor-mode frames, unsolicited output) and is responsible for
 * keeping or ignoring it. A full subscriber queue never stalls the RX task:
 * the chunk is dropped for that subscriber and counted.
 *
 * ## Modal protocol + claims
 * The chip is modal: strict request->response (terminated by the '>' prompt)
 * vs monitor-class streaming commands (ATMA/ATMR/ATMT/STM..; stopped by
 * sending a SPACE: never CR, which repeats the last command). Arbitration
 * is a light claim model:
 *   - obd_chip_request() claims COMMAND internally for one transaction.
 *   - a bridge running a monitor command claims MONITOR; while held,
 *     request() fails fast with ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE (v1 policy "manual":
 *     the settings key `monitor_policy` reserves "auto_interrupt").
 *   - firmware update claims EXCLUSIVE; normal fan-out pauses.
 *
 * Configuration is a settings descriptor ("obd_chip"), reboot-to-apply.
