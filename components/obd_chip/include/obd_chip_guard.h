/**
 * @file obd_chip_guard.h
 * @brief The chip's EEPROM guard (PURE, host-tested; implemented in
 *        obd_chip_parse.c). Dependency-free so autopid's config parser and
 *        the UDS transport can call it from their pure halves.
 *
 * The MIC3624 (ELM327 dialect) persists a handful of settings to EEPROM,
 * and EEPROM has a write budget. Init strings replay on every poll
 * transition, apps re-send their setup on every connect, and a terminal
 * user can type anything, so the wire is guarded at the driver (2026-09-16,
 * meatpi: "fix any OBD chip command that writes to eeprom"):
 *
 *   rewritten in place, same length, case/spacing kept:
 *     ATSP.. (set + SAVE protocol)     -> ATTP.. (try protocol, RAM only)
 *     ATM1   (memory on: every later
 *             protocol change sticks)  -> ATM0
 *   refused (no RAM-only twin; the raw path answers the ELM "?"):
 *     ATPP .. SV/ON/OFF  programmable parameters (0C/0F re-baud the UART:
 *                        a bricked link), ATPPS (the summary READ) passes
 *     ATSD hh            store data byte
 *     ATCV dddd          voltage calibration
 *     STWBR              write UART baud rate (STN dialect)
 *     STSAVCAL           save calibration (STN dialect)
 *
 * A token counts only at a command boundary (buffer start, or after CR /
 * LF / space / tab / ';'), so "DATA", "ATSTFF" (the "ST" inside) and hex
 * payloads never match. Boot provisioning (obd_chip.c bare_probe: STSL*,
 * ATPP 0E/0F, STWBR, once, behind a matching check) and the firmware
 * update flow write the UART directly and are not guarded by design.
