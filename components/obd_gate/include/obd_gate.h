/**
 * @file obd_gate.h
 * @brief The vehicle-bus conversation gate (policy component).
 *
 * The WiCAN Pro has TWO OBD requesters on the SAME physical CAN bus: the
 * MIC3624 OBD chip (obd_chip, driven by apps over BLE/TCP/WS/USB) and any
 * ESP-side requester on the TWAI controller (an add-on pack's virtual ELM
 * jacks). Both address the
 * ECU functionally (0x7DF) and both hear every 0x7E8.. response — when two
 * request/response conversations OVERLAP, a requester can attribute the
 * other's response to its own request (bad data: the driving-app +
 * autopid clash, meatpi 2026-07-11).
 *
 * This gate serializes those conversations: one holder at a time, keyed by
 * an opaque owner pointer (the chip, or one engine instance). Enabled by
 * default (`obd_gate` settings, reboot-to-apply); disabled = every call is
 * a no-op.
 *
 * Semantics (fail-open by design — the gate is a data-quality guard, never
 * an availability hazard):
 *  - acquire() waits up to @p wait_ms for the gate, then TAKES it anyway
 *    (counted + warned) — a wedged holder can't brick the other side.
 *  - a hold auto-expires after OBD_GATE_HOLD_MS (a holder that never
 *    releases — e.g. a monitor command with no '>' prompt — self-clears).
 *  - re-acquire by the CURRENT holder just extends the hold (a multi-step
 *    conversation stays owned).
