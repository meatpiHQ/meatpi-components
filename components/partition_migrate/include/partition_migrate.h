/**
 * @file partition_migrate.h
 * @brief The partition table in flash becomes this build's when a safe
 *        migration exists (2026-10-10).
 *
 * An OTA writes an app slot only. A unit updated from a firmware with
 * another partition layout keeps that layout: the WiCAN Pro factory
 * firmware (v4.5x) has ONE 6 MB `storage` where v6 keeps `settings` +
 * `storage`, so after the update nothing could persist (41 x `persist
 * failed`, the boot_errors fault, a factory reset that fails). This
 * component compares the table in flash with the one this build was made
 * with (embedded from the build's partition-table.bin) and rewrites it
 * when only data partitions differ: the app slots, `otadata`, `phy_init`
 * and `nvs` must be identical, so the bootloader finds the same image and
 * the calibration and keys stay. The data partitions' owners format what
 * they then find (settings_manager and filesystem probe their superblocks).
 *
 * Cost: a 3 KB read at every boot; once in a unit's life one 4 KB sector
 * erase and one page write at the table's offset, measured on the WiCAN
 * Pro (see README.md), then a restart by the caller.
 *
 * Needs `CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_DANGEROUS_WRITE_ALLOWED`: without it the IDF
 * flash driver refuses the write (the result is then
 * PARTITION_MIGRATE_NEEDED with an error line, never an abort).
