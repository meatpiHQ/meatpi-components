/**
 * @file restart_tracker.h
 * @brief WiCAN restart tracker (core component).
 *
 * Answers "why did the device reboot?" across warm restarts without touching
 * flash: its state lives in PSRAM `.noinit` (EXT_RAM_NOINIT_ATTR) guarded by
 * a magic/version/CRC envelope. A power cycle leaves random PSRAM: the
 * envelope detects that and starts fresh; any warm reset (esp_restart, panic,
 * watchdog, brownout-less resets) preserves the full history.
 *
 * Two jobs:
 *  1. Every boot, record one history entry: reset reason, timestamp (when
 *     wall time is valid), and (if the previous run declared it) the
 *     planned reason/source of the restart.
 *  2. Give the firmware ONE sanctioned way to reboot on purpose:
 *     restart_tracker_restart(reason, source, flags). Transports that call
 *     esp_restart() directly rob the next boot of its "why".
 *
 * Lifecycle: restart_tracker_init() must run EARLY in main (right after
 * log_manager_init) so the boot record is written before anything can crash.
 * start()/stop() exist for lifecycle uniformity (Coding Standard §3) and are
 * no-ops: the component is passive after init.
