/**
 * @file restart_tracker_private.h
 * @brief Pure state-machine core (restart_tracker_core.c) — no IDF deps, so
 *        the host unit tests compile it directly. Time, uptime, and the reset
 *        reason are injected by the caller; restart_tracker.c is the target
 *        glue (locking, PSRAM noinit placement, cache msync, esp_* sources).
