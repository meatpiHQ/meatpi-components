/**
 * @file script_engine_examples.c
 * @brief The built-in example scripts (2026-09-07): the Scripts page's
 *        gallery. Each is a complete, commented Berry program a user can
 *        open, run and edit; they ship in the firmware (not on the file
 *        system) so they follow the bindings and never get lost. PURE —
 *        host-tested for shape (valid ids, under the inline size cap).
 *
 * Every example was run on the bench against the ECU simulator; keep them
 * runnable when bindings change.
