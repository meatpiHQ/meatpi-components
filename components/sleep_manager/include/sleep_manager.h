/**
 * @file sleep_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN low-power manager (feature component): rewrite of
 *        legacy `sleep_mode.c` (TASK_sleep_manager.md).
 *
 * Model: battery voltage (from battery_monitor, this component owns
 * NO ADC) drives a pure policy ladder: NORMAL → LOW_VOLTAGE (below
 * sleep_voltage, a countdown of sleep_delay_min) → SLEEPING →
 * WAKE_PENDING (voltage recovered and stable) → **reboot**
 * (restart_tracker POWER_WAKE) rather than resume-in-place: every
 * manager restarts clean, the legacy-proven approach.
 *
 * SLEEPING = repeated LIGHT sleep with a 2 s timer wake (voltage still
 * sampled between naps; the timer wake doubles as meatpi's bench
 * failsafe: the device can never be stranded in a state only an
 * external signal can leave). Entry sequence: `sleep.entering` event →
 * wait for autopid idle → main's prepare callback (ordered component
 * stops, composition-root glue, so this component doesn't depend on
 * wifi/ble/mqtt/...) → CAN transceiver standby → OBD chip sleep
 * (verified each nap, ≤6 re-sleeps then recovery reboot) → USB power
 * rail held low.
 *
 * Boot-loop guard (legacy parity): ≥3 unexpected resets while the
 * battery reads below the error threshold forces sleep instead of
 * another crash lap. Critical floor (2026-10-01): a battery under
 * 11.90 V for 5 min (300 s since 2026-10-06, 120 s before) sleeps
 * regardless of the `enabled` setting and of a longer sleep delay; the
 * normal wake rules apply afterwards.
 *
 * Bench-safety (meatpi 2026-07-07): the state task arms only after a
 * 15 s boot grace period (a bootloop still leaves a flash window),
 * and all sleeping is timer-woken light sleep: no deep sleep, no
 * wake source that can silently never fire.
 *
 * Settings schema v3 (2026-10-01): `wake_mv` is a setting of its own
 * (12100..15000, default 13200; documents from v2 get sleep + 100 mV).
 * The applied wake threshold is never under sleep + 0.1 V.
 * Schema v4 (2026-10-01): `wake_delay_ms` (100..5000, default 500) is how
 * long the battery must stay above the wake voltage before the wake
 * reboot (was a fixed 1 s); older documents get the default.
 *
 * The countdown (2026-10-06): the status says which rule will put the
 * awake device to sleep first (the sleep delay, or the critical floor,
 * which overtakes a longer delay) and in how many seconds, so the UI can
 * count it down instead of the device going quiet on the user. The hold
 * (same day): the UI offers ten more minutes, three times per boot
 * (sleep_manager_hold(), `POST /api/sleep/hold`, `sleep hold`).
