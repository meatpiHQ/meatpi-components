/**
 * @file socket_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN TCP/UDP server owner (service component).
 *
 * Runs multiple listeners on different ports simultaneously (settings-defined,
 * up to SOCKET_MANAGER_MAX_SERVERS), each robust across client churn, Wi-Fi
 * drops and interface restarts. Every server presents the firmware's standard
 * chunk-stream face — queue-based RX (subscribe) + send() TX — so a server
 * plugs into bridge_manager as an endpoint with three-line glue.
 *
 * Content-agnostic: no protocol logic lives here (that is translator
 * territory, see bridge_manager).
 *
 * Semantics (see README):
 *  - TCP multi-client AGGREGATE: send() fans out to all connected clients;
 *    RX from any client merges into the one subscriber queue (transparent-
 *    bridge behavior; per-client addressing is out of scope v1).
 *  - UDP: RX from anyone on the port; TX to the last peer heard from.
 *  - Reboot-to-apply (standard §4.2): servers are built once at start() from
 *    the boot-applied settings; changing them = persist + reboot.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   socket_manager_init();   // registers settings + log descriptors
 *   settings_manager_start();
 *   socket_manager_start();  // opens the enabled listeners
