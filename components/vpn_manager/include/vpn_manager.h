/**
 * @file vpn_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN VPN client (feature component) — WireGuard over the
 *        vendored `esp_wireguard` port (rewrite of legacy vpn_manager,
 *        TASK_vpn_manager.md).
 *
 * Model: settings describe ONE WireGuard peer (reboot-to-apply like
 * everything). start() arms a small state task gated on
 * DEV_STATUS_NETWORK_CONNECTED_MASK *and* a valid clock (WireGuard
 * handshakes carry timestamps — rtc_manager restores time at boot; a
 * fresh board waits and retries): it connects when the uplink is up,
 * polls peer liveness, tears down on network loss and reconnects with
 * backoff. Connected state = DEV_STATUS_BIT_VPN_ENABLED + the
 * `vpn.state {connected}` event.
 *
 * Routing: only the configured allowed_ip range routes into the
 * tunnel unless `default_route` is set (default OFF — meatpi
 * 2026-07-07). Optional DNS override (saved/restored around the
 * connection, the legacy behavior).
 *
 * Keys: `POST /api/vpn/keygen` generates a fresh Curve25519 pair ON
 * the device and stores the private key straight into pending
 * settings — the response carries ONLY the public key (register it at
 * the server). Settings GETs redact `private_key`/`preshared_key`
 * (api_http secret suffixes); "" on PUT keeps the stored value.
