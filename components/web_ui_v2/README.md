# web_ui_v2

The **v2** built-in web app — a self-contained, responsive single-page
application that covers every `/api` + `/ws` feature. Like v6 it is
**API-first**: just another client, no privileged paths.

## Choosing the UI at build time

`Kconfig` adds a choice (menuconfig → *WiCAN built-in web UI*):

| Option | What compiles |
|---|---|
| **v2** (default) | this component — one gzipped `index.html` |
| **v6** | `components/web_ui` — the legacy ES-module pages |
| **None** | headless: `/api` + `/ws` only, no UI blob in flash |

Only the selected UI is embedded; `main` calls both `web_ui_v2_register()`
and `web_ui_register()` but the unselected one is a no-op. API/WS routes
always win because the catch-all is installed last.

Set it with `idf.py menuconfig` or in `sdkconfig.defaults`:
```
CONFIG_WICAN_WEBUI_V2=y     # or CONFIG_WICAN_WEBUI_V6=y / CONFIG_WICAN_WEBUI_NONE=y
```

## Design — "WiCAN Pro" (2026-07-10)

The visual system and information architecture come from **meatpi's
claude.ai/design project "WiCAN Pro configuration interface"**
(`WiCAN Pro.dc.html`, imported via the design MCP) and are implemented
over the existing SPA engine. One file, zero dependencies (no framework,
no CDN — the JetBrains Mono stack falls back to system monospace). It is
gzipped at build time (`gzip_asset.py`) and embedded (~39 KB gz).

- **Shell**: 58 px header — meatpi WiCAN Pro logo · connection pill
  (pulse dot, device id, IP, AP/STA tag) · theme toggle · a header
  **Submit Changes** button that batches settings PUTs + submit (the
  old apply-bar semantics, incl. the unsaved-changes guard).
- **Nav**: DEVICE group (the designed 12 tabs) + TOOLS group (the
  deeper diagnostic pages); a warning card at the bottom surfaces
  degraded / restart-pending components. Wraps to a chip row ≤ 860 px.
- **Connection watchdog**: 3 s `/api/status` poll drives the pill,
  offline/reboot banners, and page re-render on reconnect.
- **Theme**: light-default per the design, full dark theme, follows the
  OS and a manual toggle (persisted).
- **Schema-driven settings**: forms are generated from
  `GET /api/settings/<name>/schema`, grouped into the design's cards —
  new firmware fields appear with no UI change.

## UX audit (2026-09-05) — the rules every page now follows

Screenshot-driven pass over all 23 routes on desktop and a Pixel-class
phone against a live WiCAN Pro (`tools/webui_preview` smoke + probes
green afterwards). What changed, and what to keep doing:

- **Phones render the desktop layout.** The viewport meta is
  `width=1024` (not `device-width`): a phone lays the page out at
  1024 CSS px and zooms to fit — exactly Chrome's "Desktop site" — so
  the sidebar + cards look the same everywhere and nobody has to tick
  that box (meatpi request). Pinch-zoom stays on. The ≤ 860 px
  responsive rules remain for narrow desktop windows only.
- **Field dictionary.** The device schema has no titles/help, so the
  form engine owns the wording: `LABELS` / `HELP` / `ENUMS` /
  `PLACEHOLDER` maps (a `"component.key"` entry beats a bare `key`),
  with `flabel()` as the fallback (sentence case, acronyms upper-cased,
  `_s/_ms/_min/_dbm` → "(s)" etc.). New firmware fields still appear
  automatically — add a dictionary line when the generated label reads
  badly. Enum values are shown as words (`apsta` → "Access point +
  Station") while the stored value stays the raw enum.
- **Controls by type.** Booleans are toggle switches (`switchCtl`),
  never Enable/Disable dropdowns. Bounded integers with a span ≤ 1500
  and every `*_mv` voltage are a slider + number pair (`sliderCtl`;
  volts with 0.05 V steps, stored as mV) — `NO_SLIDER` lists the
  exceptions (ports, "-1 = forever" counters). Secrets come back
  redacted (`""` = keep on PUT), so password inputs carry an
  "unchanged — type to replace" placeholder instead of looking empty.
- **Layout.** `.frow` labels top-align to the control's first line
  (tall controls keep their label at the top); help text sits under the
  control column; number inputs cap at 240 px; two-column card grids
  use `.cols2` (collapses < 700 px).
- **One save model, one button.** The header **Submit Changes** button
  is the only "apply" affordance for staged settings — the per-card
  "Submit to apply" badges were removed (meatpi). Only cards that write
  to the device immediately are marked (`liveBadge`, e.g. Parameters).
- **Sub-tabs on long pages** (`tabbedPage(container, base, tabs, sub)`):
  Settings (WiFi · Bluetooth · CAN bus · Connections · MQTT), Automate
  (Settings · Parameters · Data destinations · Home Assistant), USB
  (Status · Settings · Dongle console), System (Maintenance ·
  Certificates · Firmware update), Trouble Codes (Codes · Code databases
  · Settings), Rules & Events (Rules · Live events · Triggers & actions).
  Every pane is built once; a tab click only toggles visibility and
  rewrites the hash with `history.replaceState` (no `hashchange`, so the
  page is NOT re-run — staged edits and live pollers survive), while
  `#/<page>/<tab>` deep-links land on that tab via the router's `sub`.
- **Sidebar accordion (2026-09-06).** The sub-tabs live in the sidebar:
  a section that has them shows a chevron, and while it is the active
  section its sub-tab list drops under its button (animated
  `grid-template-rows` 0fr→1fr, honours `prefers-reduced-motion`); every
  other section stays collapsed (meatpi: "when I click Settings the
  sub-tabs drop under Settings"). `NAV[].sub` is the ONE list of tab ids
  + labels — `tabbedPage()` reads its labels from there (and warns when
  a page passes a tab id that is missing from it), so adding a tab means
  adding it to `NAV` and passing `{id, el}` from the page. Clicking a
  sub-tab of the page that is already open calls the page's registered
  `show()` (`subNav`) — an in-place pane switch, no route, staged edits
  kept; clicking the open section's own button goes to its first tab the
  same way; anything else routes to `#/<page>/<tab>`. The in-page
  `.subtabs` strip is `display:none` on the sidebar layout and only
  shows under 860 px, where the sidebar becomes a chip row that cannot
  nest. Verified with a Playwright flow on hardware (expand, in-place
  switch with a staged edit kept, guard modal, deep link, narrow window).
- **DOM hygiene.** `Element.append/prepend/replaceChildren` are wrapped
  once to drop `null`/`false` children — conditional children
  (`cond ? el : null`) used to print the word "null" on the page.
- **Automate split by concern (2026-09-06).** The old "Behaviour" tab
  mixed the master switch with per-PID-group settings. Now the
  **Settings** tab (card "Automate settings" — meatpi preferred that
  over "Polling") holds `enabled`, the pause rules and, under advanced,
  the event rate limit / console flag; each PID group's
  own switch, init chain and (standard) protocol head that group's pane
  on the **Parameters** tab, and the vehicle name + init sit above the
  profile picker. Picking a profile in the dropdown IS the load (the
  vehicle-specific PIDs are replaced live, name + init staged for
  Submit); **Fetch latest** re-reads the published list with caches
  bypassed, and the device's current car is preselected on first load
  (meatpi 2026-09-06 — no separate Load Profile button). The pause threshold is one
  "Pause polling" choice — *below the Power Saving sleep voltage* /
  *below a voltage I choose* / *never* — mapped onto the firmware's
  `pause_below_mv` (0 = no fixed threshold) + `pause_follow_sleep`; the
  custom slider runs 12.0–14.5 V in 0.1 V steps (a 12 V vehicle
  battery) instead of the schema's 0–30 V (meatpi). Every autopid form
  on the page shares ONE values object (`av`) so a single staged PUT
  carries all edits. The other voltage sliders keep their firmware
  bounds (8–16 V), which are already sensible.
- **Interactive pass (2026-09-06, meatpi: "click everything, ranges
  must make sense").** A Playwright crawler (`ux_crawl.js`, scratchpad)
  visited all 38 routes/sub-tabs, flipped every switch, drove every
  slider to both ends, cycled every select and clicked every safe
  button: 0 console errors, 0 stray "null" text, every control
  behaved. What changed: the sleep / wake / pause thresholds are
  bounded in the FIRMWARE schema for a 12 V battery (sleep 12.0–14.0 V,
  chip sleep 12.0–14.0 V, chip wake 12.0–15.0 V and forced above sleep
  by `on_validate`, pause ≤ 14.5 V), the sleep delay is 1–30 min, the
  periodic check-in ≥ 5 min and the chip's sleep hold ≤ 60 min — each
  with a schema bump + clamping migration, so stored values never
  degrade a component; all voltage sliders step 0.1 V; the periodic
  wake interval only shows once periodic wake-up is on; the DTC clear
  mode dropdown uses words; the DBC monitor-window and UDS timeout
  boxes carry bounds; IMU sensitivity/threshold rows explain their
  units. Bench note: the Logs page's sink chips toggle sinks LIVE — a
  crawler must not click them (they are in its deny list now).
- **Sleep-off safeguards (meatpi 2026-09-06, the pre-v6 reminder).**
  Sleep mode ships ON with a 5 min delay and a 12.0–14.0 V threshold
  (firmware floor 12.0 V). While sleep is off — on the device, or
  staged in the form — a permanent warning chip sits in the header
  ("Sleep mode off — the vehicle battery can drain", links to Power
  Saving); `paintSleepWarn()` runs from `renderSubmit()`, at boot and
  on every reconnect (`refreshSleep()` reads `/api/sleep`). Submitting
  settings while sleep will be off replaces the plain restart confirm
  with an acknowledgement modal whose **Submit anyway** button stays
  disabled until the "I understand…" box is ticked (`sleepAckModal()`).
  Verified end to end on hardware (stage off → warning; submit → ack →
  reboot → warning persists from device state; re-enable → plain
  confirm → warning gone).
- **Terminal readiness.** A fresh device ships with the `ws_cli`
  channel disabled and no `cli ⇄ ws_cli` bridge, so the WiCAN console
  terminal's Connect was refused silently for every new user. The page
  now reads `websocket_manager` + `bridge_manager`, disables Connect and
  shows a warning with an **Enable WiCAN console** button when the
  selected terminal (console → `/ws/cli`, ELM327 → `/ws/obd`) is not
  bridged; the button stages the channel + `br_cli`/`br_obd` bridge
  (parking any other bridge on that interface — single-consumer rule)
  for the header Submit. A refused socket prints why instead of a bare
  "[disconnected]". Verified end to end on hardware (enable → Submit →
  reboot → Connect → `help`).
- Page fixes from the pass: Settings split into WiFi Access Point ·
  WiFi Network (Station, Scan → click to pick) · Bluetooth cards;
  Connections rows are one line ([iface] ⇄ [conn] + switch); Dashboard
  empty state is a card, not a squeezed tile; Logger Pause is disabled
  while the logger is off; Files never percent-encodes `/` (the fs API
  rejects `%2F`) and offers `/data` + `/sd` at the root; Logs classify
  lines by the IDF level letter; About/pill take the device id from
  `/api/info` (`/api/status` has none); USB page ordered status →
  settings → console.
- Logger page rework (2026-09-06): the status reads the real card
  state (`/api/status` `sdcard_mounted` + `/api/fs/info`) — one chip per
  state (Off / Recording / Paused / Waiting for storage / No SD card)
  and per-stream figures instead of a flat list of dashes; settings
  split into Logger settings · Vehicle parameters · CAN frames (each
  stream discloses progressively, per-format guidance paints live, the
  retention total is checked against the card size, a "nothing
  selected" nudge and a CAN-bus-off warning); the CAN filter is a
  choice (all frames / matching IDs) with 11/29-bit width, sanitised
  hex and the matched ID range spelled out; the newest log files list
  on the page with the write-locked active files marked "in use";
  Files deep-links (`#/files/sd/logs`).
- Dashboard rework (2026-09-06): the header chip shows the real state
  (Automate off / Polling / Paused on battery / Not polling — the old
  page never noticed Automate was off because `/api/autopid` has no
  `enabled`; it reads `/api/status` `autopid_enabled` now); a strip with
  one switch per polling group (runtime `/api/autopid/group`, labelled
  temporary) and chips for PID/filter counts, the measured poll rate and
  failures (+ the sub-floor warning the API asks for); each tile has the
  class icon, a sparkline of the last ~2 minutes, the bar over the
  parameter's min/max from Automate (session autoscale only when unset,
  and it says so), the PID / filter / "External (GPS)" source and the
  value's age — stale values fade. Empty states link to Automate →
  Settings / Parameters. Vehicle-profile import normalises the
  mis-encoded degree sign (`\uFFFD` → `°`).
- Dashboard customisation (2026-09-06): Customise puts a gear on every
  tile — widget (automatic · number · bar · dial · trend · chart), range
  (the parameter's min/max from Automate, or custom), warn below / above
  (amber value and dial arc), decimals, width (1–2 columns), hide — and
  the tiles drag to reorder; the layout is ONE file on the device
  (`/data/dashboard.json`, written through `/api/fs/upload`) so every
  phone and PC sees the same dashboard, and Reset layout deletes it.
  Charts use uPlot 1.6.31 (MIT), NOT embedded: the page downloads the
  pinned build from cdn.jsdelivr.net, checks size + FNV-1a, stores it
  under `/data/cache/www` (or `/sd/cache/www` when flash is short; with
  neither it says an SD card is needed) and loads it from `/cache/www/`
  — the `/cache/*` → `/data/cache` and `/sdcache/*` → `/sd/cache` prefix
  assets `web_ui_v2.c` registers (MIME by extension, ETag/304,
  max-age 3600). Anything under cache/ is re-creatable.
- Dashboard history from the logger (user request 2026-09-06): a chart
  tile backfills its parameter from the data_logger's parameter files in
  ANY of the four formats (window per tile: 15 min / 1 h / 3 h / 6 h),
  then continues live. JSON lines and CSV stream through
  `/api/logger/export?name=<param>` (cursor walked from the newest file
  that starts before the window); binary `.wdl` and SQLite `.db` files
  are fetched whole through `/api/fs/download` (the file being written is
  read after pausing the logger's gate, resumed right after — unpaused it
  answers 409 `file in use`, which the page retries for a few seconds
  because a SQLite commit in flight delays the release) and decoded
  in the browser — the `.wdl` reader mirrors `tools/wdl_dump.py`, SQLite
  uses sql.js 1.14.2 (WebAssembly, 690 KB, MIT) installed on demand under
  `cache/www` exactly like the chart library (`DASH_RES` registry: pinned
  size + FNV-1a, internal flash first, SD card fallback, "insert an SD
  card" when neither has room). Decoded files are cached in memory; record times are shifted by the browser-vs-`/api/rtc` offset so
  an unset device clock still lines up (the note says "device clock not
  set"). Other formats, a logger that is off or `autopid_log=off` get a
  one-line reason with a link to Logger. Samples live in a page-level
  store (`DASH_HIST`, 25k per parameter) that survives navigating away.
  Probe: `probe_dash_history.mjs`.
- WiFi Network card (2026-09-06): while the station is not connected and
  the last attempts failed, a plain-language line says which network,
  why (`/api/wifi/status` `sta_attempt`: reason + failure streak) and what
  the firmware does next (other networks first, then this one again — the
  timed ban is gone), with the hint to correct the password here.
  Probe: `probe_wifi_why.mjs`.
- Size budget (2026-09-06): the build now minifies index.html —
  `gzip_asset.py` runs rjsmin/rcssmin (vendored under `tools/`,
  Apache-2.0, pure Python, so the IDF Python is enough) before gzipping:
  91.6 KB → 82.0 KB gzipped WITH the dashboard customisation and the
  logger history, under the 85.3 KB the UI shipped at before them. `tools/webui_preview/make_preview.py
  --min` builds the preview through the same function so the smoke test
  and probes (`probe_dash_custom.mjs` for the customisation) test what
  ships.
- No OBD chip card (meatpi 2026-09-07): the Advanced page lost the
  `obd_chip` settings card. Its fields (auto sleep, monitor policy, the
  chip's sleep thresholds) only confused users, and the chip UART baud is
  now a firmware constant (`OBD_CHIP_BAUD`; obd_chip settings v3 drops a
  stored value) — a user changing it would break the chip and claim
  warranty. The group stays reachable through the settings API / CLI /
  backup; the UI keeps no labels, enums or formatters for it.
- Motion defaults + Power Saving flag (meatpi 2026-09-07): the IMU stays
  on by default, but "Wake on motion" (the sensor's bump detector) ships
  off with a 125 mg threshold. When it is on, the Power Saving page shows
  a warning banner naming it, linking to Advanced, and stating what it
  really does: bump events for rules/MQTT, no wake from sleep. The
  Motion card hides the threshold while it is off and the SMD knobs while
  SMD is off; the help text no longer claims a knock wakes the device.
  Probe: `probe_power_flag.mjs`.
- Last wake-up on Status (meatpi 2026-09-07): the System card names this
  boot's cause in plain words from `/api/restart/history` — "Battery
  voltage recovered — woke from sleep", "Periodic check-in — woke from
  sleep" (new restart_tracker reason `periodic_wake`; sleep_manager used
  to file check-ins as power_wake), "Restart requested · web UI",
  "Settings applied", "Firmware update", or the chip's own reset cause
  ("Power-on", "Crash (panic) — unexpected", watchdogs, brown-out).
  Motion slots in once wake-on-motion exists. Probe:
  `probe_wake_source.mjs` (the mock's last record is
  `__mockState.lastRestart`).
- File Manager (meatpi 2026-09-07: "improve the UI and UX of the Files
  tab, rename it File Manager"): the page ships as the second on-demand
  chunk (`web/files.js` → `/ui/files.js`, `PAGES.files` stub). Landing =
  storage cards (internal flash / SD card with usage meters, "not mounted"
  when the card is absent); inside a mount: breadcrumb that also drives
  the URL (`#/files/sd/logs` deep links keep working), Up, a usage line,
  filter + sort, multi-select with Delete selected, New folder, multi-file
  Upload with a progress bar (XHR) and drag-and-drop onto the list,
  per-row Preview (text files ≤ 64 KB, JSON pretty-printed), Download,
  Copy path and Delete; the folders users meet carry a one-line
  description; the logger's active file (`/api/logger` dir/file while
  running) is marked "in use" with Delete disabled and a hint to pause
  logging; non-empty folders and in-use files get plain-language errors.
  Bug found on the way: the old page's New folder never worked — it
  posted the path as a JSON body while `/api/fs/mkdir` reads `?path=`
  like every other fs route (bench-verified 2026-09-07).
  Probe: `probe_files.mjs` (the mock lists `__mockState.files` / `dirs`
  dynamically, honours `sdMounted` / `loggerRunning`, and shims
  XMLHttpRequest).
- WiFi settings (meatpi 2026-09-07: "the WiFi mode should not be in the
  AP settings; no open security"): the mode is a tile selector (Access
  point + Station · Station only · Access point only · WiFi off, with a
  warning for off; no tile is labelled recommended, meatpi) above the two cards; each card carries a live chip
  (AP: clients + address; station: connected + IP / not connected / off)
  and folds to a one-line note when the mode does not use it; "Open (no
  password)" is gone from AP security (firmware enum v7 with an
  open → auto migration; the page also filters it out of an older
  schema). Probe: `probe_wifi_mode.mjs`.
- Factory AP password (meatpi 2026-09-07: "we should not allow submitting
  the password if it is still the default"): while `/api/wifi/status`
  reports `ap_default_password`, the header shows "Factory AP password:
  change it" (links to Settings → WiFi), a warning sits under the AP
  password field, and Submit stops with an explanation whenever the
  staged WiFi settings would keep it (blank = keep, or `@meatpi#` typed).
  The firmware refuses such a write after boot anyway (wifi_manager
  `on_validate`). Probe: `probe_ap_password.mjs` (mock flag
  `__mockState.apDefaultPassword`, PUT counter `__mockState.puts`).
- CAN Monitor (meatpi 2026-09-07: "the monitor tab seems broken: the start
  button is already pressed but nothing shows; bring it as close as possible
  to our mockup"): a fresh WiCAN Pro has the native CAN bus, the `/ws/can`
  channel and the slcan connection all off, so the old page sat "receiving"
  over an empty table. The page is now an on-demand chunk (`web/monitor.js`)
  laid out like the PCAN-style mockup: Connection (bus + WebSocket chips, a
  wiring check that names what is missing and an "Enable CAN monitor"
  button staging `can_manager.enabled` + the `ws_can` channel + a `br_can`
  slcan bridge, Pause/Resume, Reconnect, bit rate and listen-only staged
  into can_manager), Message filter (ID range + data/remote/standard/
  extended switches), Send message (ID, data, extended, remote, cycle,
  Send / Cyclic / Add to list, a persisted transmit list), Trace tools
  (buffer 200/1000/5000, auto-scroll, Clear, Save CSV); the table shows
  Time · Dir · ID · Type · DLC · Data · ASCII (Grouped: bytes with a hot
  highlight, ASCII, cycle, count); the status bar shows RX · TX · Errors
  (from `/api/can` bus_errors, TEC/REC etc. in the tooltip) · Rate · Bus
  load · Connected/Paused · Buffer · Auto-scroll. SUPERSEDED the same day
  by the design below.
- CAN Monitor, second pass (Ali, 2026-09-07: "i found the design i wanted,
  implement this", the Claude Design export "WiCAN PRO Monitor"): the page
  became the design's three-tab PCAN-View style analyzer (see the Pages
  list): receive list with decode panel, transmit list with context menu and
  keyboard shortcuts, edit dialog with byte boxes, trace, settings cards,
  status bar, connect dialog; its own light/dark palette from the design
  (`.pmv` tokens, prefixed `--p*` so the app's tokens stay untouched);
  shipped transmit rows are manual (nothing goes on a vehicle bus by
  itself); the page OPENS PAUSED (Ali: "it should be paused by default";
  the socket connects, Resume starts counting and listing); CAN FD
  controls render disabled (the TWAI controller has no FD);
  prefs in localStorage `wican.canmon.v1`. Probe: `probe_monitor.mjs` (mock
  `__mockState.canEnabled`, `wsCanPeriod`, `wsSent`, `wsCanRefuse`,
  `dbcs`, `dbcSignals`).
- Logger robustness surfaces (2026-09-07, data_logger/ROBUSTNESS.md): the
  Logger status shows a warning banner while `*.corrupt` files are set
  aside (what happened, `tools/db_recover.py`, link to the File Manager)
  and a chip "N records recovered after the last reset"; the File Manager
  labels `.corrupt` files; the flush-interval help explains the trade-off.
  Mock: `__mockState.loggerCorrupt` / `loggerSalvaged`.

## On-demand page chunks (2026-09-07)

The main page must not grow (meatpi: "we cannot increase the size of the
web UI"), so a heavy, rarely opened page can ship as its own chunk:
`web/scripts.js` is minified (rjsmin) and gzipped by `gzip_asset.py` at
build time, embedded next to `index.html.gz` and served at
`/ui/scripts.js` (`web_ui_v2.c` asset table, `application/javascript`,
`Content-Encoding: gzip`). `index.html` keeps a four-line stub
(`PAGES.scripts`) that `loadScript()`s the chunk the first time the page
opens and then calls `PAGES.__scripts`; the chunk is a classic script, so
it shares the page's global scope (`h`, `page`, `tabbedPage`,
`settingsForm`, `api`, `UI_RES`, …), injects its own CSS and registers its
library in `UI_RES`. Sizes at the split: index.html.gz 84.6 KB (84.4 KB
before the Scripts work; the stub, nav entry, icons and dictionary lines
are the difference), scripts.js.gz 8.5 KB. `make_preview.py` inlines every
chunk after the app script so the jsdom probes run it (the stub sees
`PAGES.__scripts` already defined and never fetches). To add another
chunk: a `web/<name>.js` that sets `PAGES.__<name>`, a stub in
`index.html`, one more custom command + embed in `CMakeLists.txt`, one
more asset row in `web_ui_v2.c`, and its name in `make_preview.py`'s
chunk list. Chunks today: `scripts.js` (Scripts), `files.js` (File
Manager) and `monitor.js` (CAN Monitor, 2026-09-07).

Settings — the Editor tab is a full-width "Stored scripts" table (name,
size, Open · Run · Download · Delete per row, the open one highlighted;
meatpi: a stacked side list was not intuitive) above an editor card whose
header names the open file and carries the Saved / Unsaved / Running
chip; scripts are files under `/data/scripts` created, opened, saved,
renamed, run, checked, downloaded and deleted in the browser; Run sends the
editor's text inline (saves and runs by name past the 8 KB inline cap),
Check compiles only; output lines that name `string:<line>:` are
jump-to-line links and a matching hint from the firmware's `errors` table
shows under the output; CodeMirror 5 (highlighting via a simple-mode
Berry grammar, line numbers, bracket matching, autocomplete of the
bindings + globals + keywords, Ctrl-S / Ctrl-Enter / Ctrl-Space /
Ctrl-/) is an on-demand library in the same `UI_RES` registry as uPlot
and sql.js — nine files under `cache/www`, a plain textarea until it is
installed; the Examples gallery and the whole Reference (bindings with
Insert, globals, a Berry primer, the rule recipe, error hints, limits)
are rendered from `GET /api/scripts/reference` + `/examples`, so the page
never drifts from the bindings; CodeMirror runs with its own `wican`
theme so the tokens take the page's colour variables in both light and
dark mode (its stock palette is light-only); the scripting settings
(enable switch, runtime budget, ECU-flashing gate) have their own tab and
go through the header Submit like every setting) · UDS Tool · J2534 ·

## Connections card (Settings page — the bridge builder)

Pure settings composition, ZERO firmware surface: each row is
[interface ▾] ⇄ [connection ▾] with contextual fields (TCP/UDP → port,
WebSocket → path, CAN → protocol raw/slcan/gvret/realdash) + enabled +
Add (max 4). Compiles into `bridge_manager.bridges` AND maintains the
backing `socket_manager.servers` (reuse by proto+port, else allocate a
free/disabled slot, name `tcp<port>`) / `websocket_manager.channels`
(reuse by path, name `ws_<path>`). Client-side guards: single-consumer rule, port and
`/ws/` path validation, slot caps, "CAN bus disabled" hint. Bridges it
can't model (hand-made relay pairings) show read-only with a pointer to
All Settings. Everything applies through the header Submit
(reboot-to-apply).

## Preview + tests WITHOUT a device — `tools/webui_preview/` (2026-07-13)

The committed harness mocks the whole `/api` + `/ws` surface in-page:

```
cd tools/webui_preview
python make_preview.py     # extracts all 34 components' settings field
                           # tables from the C sources into mocks, and
                           # injects mock_api.js into index.html
start preview.html         # clickable in any browser, zero device
npm i jsdom                # once
node smoke.mjs             # every route, assert 0 JS errors + non-empty view
node probe_automate.mjs    # interaction probe: Automate + Rules editor flows
node probe_adv.mjs         # advanced-gating visibility probe
```

Last run (2026-07-13): smoke 23 routes 0 errors; automate probe 16/16
(card order, essentials-only gating, scan→results-modal→dedup-merge,
rule-editor modal). The preview is also publishable as a claude.ai
artifact for review. Against a REAL device instead:
`cd components/web_ui_v2/web && python -m http.server 8000` then
`http://localhost:8000/?api=http://<dut-ip>`.
