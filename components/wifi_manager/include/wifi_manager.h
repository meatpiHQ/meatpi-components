/**
 * @file wifi_manager.h
 * @brief WiCAN WiFi manager (feature component).
 *
 * Owns the WiFi radio: STA with prioritized fallback networks and an
 * auth-failure ban list, AP with static IP + DHCP server, APSTA with
 * AP-auto-disable and AP-channel-follows-STA, and a supervised reconnect
 * task.
 *
 * Configuration is a settings_manager descriptor (name "wifi_manager") and
 * applies ONLY at boot (Coding Standard §4.2 reboot-to-apply): there is no
 * runtime set-mode / set-credentials API. Changing WiFi settings = PUT via
 * the settings transport, then reboot. The runtime surface below is status,
 * scanning, and event callbacks only.
 *
 * Lifecycle (composition in main):
 *   wifi_manager_init()      — allocate state, register the settings
 *                              descriptor. Before settings_manager_start().
 *   settings_manager_start() — runs on_apply (stores config; touches no HW)
 *   wifi_manager_start()     — netifs + esp_wifi up per config; refuses with
 *                              ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE if unconfigured (§4.3).
 *   wifi_manager_stop()      — stops the radio and the reconnect task.
 *
 * Requires nvs_flash_init() before start (esp_wifi dependency); main owns
 * that, per §3 ("a component assumes its dependencies are already init'd").
