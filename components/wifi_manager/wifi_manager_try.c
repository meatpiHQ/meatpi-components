/**
 * @file wifi_manager_try.c
 * @brief The connection trial over the real driver (2026-10-06): the glue
 *        around the pure machine in wifi_manager_trial.c. A runtime knob,
 *        never a setting: the credentials live here for the seconds of the
 *        trial and are gone with it (the driver's config storage is RAM).
 *        Three tasks touch the trial: httpd (begin, status), the WiFi event
 *        task (the hooks wifi_manager.c calls) and esp_timer (the 1 s tick
 *        for the budgets); one mutex orders them, and the driver is called
 *        outside it. The reconnect task stands back while a trial runs
 *        (wm_try_active()) and reconnects the configured network afterwards
 *        on its own lap.
